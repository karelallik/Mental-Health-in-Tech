By standardizing uncertain responses and converting ordinal text answers into numeric values, the data becomes easier for machine learning models to learn from. This typically leads to better model accuracy and more reliable predictions."

The co-worker I work with the most and I talk about mental health all the time and are very supportive of one another. But we are also good friends outside of work. Same as previous. My closest coworker talks to me on a regular basis about their mental health Explained that I was struggling with anxiety. The supervisor suggested I reach out to our employee assistance program for more help. On a regular basis talking about what’s going on in our lives and the mental health issues that affect us ie, anxiety and depression Same as previous answers Being open and upfront about mental health all the time as opposed to only when there’s a serious issue. Same level of comfort for each I was aware of some Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers Na Depending on what the job is and how the physical issue may affect my work, I wouldn’t feel comfortable until I knew more about the employer’s attitude'\n",
      " 'They actually brought the subject up based on how I responded to situations at work.  They were very supportive and when I made the decision to terminate my employment (I was missing a fair amount of work because of my condition), we parted on very good terms. Just that I was struggling and wanted them to pray for me, to which they assured me they would and continued to be very supportive. There is alot of media \"noise\" about it and, in general, it has been my experience that people in the industry are very supportive. Same level of comfort for each N/A (was not aware) Yes, all of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers If they are interested in hiring me, I want them to know so they can make the best decision based on me and my struggles, whether mental, physical or otherwise.'\n",
      " 'I discussed the anxiety and depression as symptoms of my adhd. They were understanding and helped make some adjustments and accommodations. A coworker and I discussed our similar mental health issues and diagnoses. It was mural beneficial. I’ve had coworkers mention their anxiety and ask for advise about managing that with their work. I mentioned my anxiety and adhd and that I wanted to make some changes to help me. She basically said it was my problem to figure out on my own. Some of us shared anecdotes about our various mental health disorders and issues. Sharing anecdotes and supporting each other I was told my issues were my own to deal with and no accommodations would be made to help me. This was specifically related to my ADHD. Discuss it openly. Allow people to work more autonomously in a way that works for them. Physical health No, I only became aware later Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers It’s generally irrelevant to my work and not work mentioning.']\n"
