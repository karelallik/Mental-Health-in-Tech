I was having a very hard time managing my anxiety and was hyperventilating and crying in the bathroom periodically. The coworkers I told about it were very supportive and helped me get the help I needed. That group of coworkers was a little older and were a great help with the administrative burden of working with an insurance company to pay for treatment. I went to my direct manager to get consistent time off during the day to go to therapy. He was supportive, but would get uncomfortable when talking about mental illness. One coworker told me he also suffers from anxiety in the workplace, so I told him the steps I've taken to manage my own."

Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out. I was at one time berated to the point of experiencing a dissociative episode while sitting in my supervisor's office with a coworker present. When I later confronted the coworker about this, they did not apologize. Also, due to symptoms earlier in the year, I experienced a lapse in performance for one week (the consequences of which were minor). As a result of this I am currently being singled out and micromanaged and my behavior in the office policed, in addition to (at least the perception of) being gaslit by my current supervisor, who ""could not"" supply concrete evidence of my lack of performance. I've unofficially disclosed diagnoses to coworkers. They haven't said anything about them to me since. One coworker in particular has been told about 3 or 4 times about a particular diagnosis and seems to have selective memory about it. ""I am not your therapist.""

The coworkers in question were not direct team members and had become defined better as friends than coworkers. So there was a level of trust and openness already established. This survey entirely misses the side of mental illness that covers Autism spectrum/non-neurotypical issues. Some of the behaviours listed can occur in High Functioning Autism but does not address it at all. This survey also entirely misses gender and other dysphorias.

Far too many of us suffer in silence because despite this common experience we share, the stigmas are so powerful that we can't openly discuss the situation, demand better treatment from our superiors, or fully disclose our condition when applying for jobs. After disclosing my mental illness to an employer, the immediate response was for them to yell ""I don't want to hear any excuses!"" and dismiss the idea of any accommodations outright. They let me go shortly thereafter. I've only ever confided in a select few coworkers who I trusted would handle my mental illness in confidence and with respect. Otherwise, I would not disclose my mental illness in a workplace environment for fear of retaliation. I've disclosed my mental health state many times as a result of its impact affecting me negatively. The response has been mixed. By superiors who knew me directly, the response was positive; by the company at large and human resources, the response was negative, as if I had suddenly become a ""burden"" to the company, and as if there was now an impetus on the company to find an engineer with my skillset but without my mental illness."

Let employees know about ADA responsibilities of employers wrt disclosures and reasonable accommodation. Actually make those reasonable accommodations rather than looking for reasons to fire people. As previously mentioned, my coworker, who was more senior, used this as an opportunity to isolate me from the rest of the team, negatively impact my performance reviews, and abuse me in a relationship. We have a support slack group for people living with mental illness, and a couple select coworkers and I hold each other accountable for self care, as we all have mental health issues that we deal with. I've mentioned, in vague terms, that I'm having mental health issues when things have gotten particularly bad. This has been helpful in requesting more structure when I'm feeling unmoored as a result of my mental illness. I told a previous coworker who I was in a relationship with about my mental health issues. He took that opportunity to try to force me to see his therapist, and used my mental health issues as a way to isolate me from the rest of our coworkers and to attempt to control me. This is a large factor in why I left my previous job and am reluctant to discuss my mental health with current coworkers and supervisors. Coworkers occasionally gossip about other people's mental health. I try not to participate in this, and am likely to cut someone off if they behave this way. As such, I'm fairly certain that some of my coworkers gossip about my mental health behind my back. A large barrier to mental health treatment is that insurance is rather tepid on the whole issue. Employers could do better by their employees by thoroughly investigating mental health coverage and authorization policies when putting together employer based healthcare plans."

My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity.

I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others. Not a response as such, but a previous manager made some derogatory comments about sufferers of ADHD that made me unwilling to open up to him when I was experiencing difficulties.

I don't talk about mental health concerns with co-workers unless I have some indication of their views on the subject first. I have been very up front about my mental health concerns with my manager. We hada talk recently about how they've been affecting my productivity. He's been very supportive and has offered to help any way he can, though I haven't come up with useful accommodations to ask for. I have talked about depression, anxiety, and ADHD with previous coworkers. I chose who to talk to based on my understanding of their views such that I always found sympathetic listeners (often those with issues of their own). I have only had coworkers talk to me about their own mental health when I have opened the conversation by bringing up my own concerns/issues.

Years ago, after a messy breakup I was on a rather short fuse for a while.  A few months afterward my CEO told me I should have brought it up to them so they could have helped reduce my stress levels at work.  By that point it had passed so no further action was taken. Having OSMI around and spreading its message makes it easier to think about what I'd do if I did develop a mental illness, so thank you."

The tone of the conversation was a solemn  empathy. Overall it was supportive, however it was not a happy conversation. I needed to talk to my supervisor regarding my need to see a therapist because I could not schedule therapy sessions outside of work hours.

My supervisor was supportive and allowed me to do whatever I needed. I believe my anonymity was protected, however the rest of the office clearly judged and placed pressure on me for leaving and returning after taking a lunch break. I talked to a co-worker because I believed my family has an diagnosed history with bi-polar.

Was going through a particularly tough spell not long after I started in the job and got extremely irritable to the point it was noticed by others.  A day or two later I took my manager to the side and told him what had been happening and that I suffer from depression and anxiety.  My managers reactions were somewhat of disbelief, he said that until that incident (which he put down to just having a couple of bad days with tough deadlines) he never would have thought I suffered from mental health issues as I'm usually very upbeat in the office.  Was told to not feel it's something I need to hide away and that if I ever needed time to myself that it would be arranged."

My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased. This was at a previous employer. In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc. In Slack, a coworker stated he was depressed and needed the teams help understanding that. It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for)."

Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to. Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress. I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan. They told me they had similar experiences that I had spoken about and were looking for guidance and connection."

Once I established a healthy relationship with my immediate manager, I was able to sense that they themselves had dealt with mental health issues of their own in the past and thus were sensitive and very supportive in helping me manage and navigate my own struggle insofar as it pertained to the professional working environment. During a bout of severe depression, I told my direct manager that I felt my performance was suffering and the job was causing me undue stress. They were receptive and made some attempts to alleviate the stress that was agitating the depression. They also offered some information and guidance on who to speak to in HR I frequently have conversations about mental health issues with a handful of coworkers including people whom I report directly to.  Often it a two-way supportive conversation, be it affirmation that what they're experiencing is normal or to be expected, or in some cases offering recommendations on how to handle things (e.g. seeing a therapist, psychiatrist, etc.) I'd just like to thank you for doing this. I've been suffering from PTSD for the majority of my life and it has affected so many aspects both in and outside of the workplace."

I've struggled with both at different points throughout my life, and it didn't seem like that big of a deal.  However, I've met a number of people in tech who deal with more complex and challenging issues, like bipolar disorder, which seems like a completely different thing to me, both in how it affects the person who has it, and how society reacts to it.

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up. A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it"

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health. For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.  My current employer from the creation of the company has emphasized the importance of mental health and those values stayed with the company as we've grown.

My supervisor made multiple requests for small accommodations that weren't only denied but ignored completely.
My VP of Engineering called me out in the team Slack for having problems with noise, then in person in the office. I usually explain that I have GAD and it's well-managed but if I need to leave a meeting or use an anxiety app on my phone, it isn't because I'm just up and out. They have for the most part been understanding of that. 
There was a time when the department head (VP of Engineering) called me out in our team Slack for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and offering me first choice of seating (changing the office layout). That was then ignored by a few of my coworkers, which prompted the VPE to make an issue of it directly in the office. All I could do was stare at the floor. I felt humiliated and ashamed, particularly that he felt he knew enough about me, without ever having spoken with me, to feel comfortable doing all of that to ""help"" me. My immediate supervisor knows and has been supportive and attentive. He doesn't always understand but he always believes me. He has made several requests on my behalf for accommodations that have been ignored across the board. Because of that, I do not feel comfortable talking about it with anyone higher than he is.
There have also been times when our department manager has called me out publicly (to the team) for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and made a big deal about arranging The previous VP Engineering was himself familiar with mental health issues and was open and understanding. I brought up my anxiety and he did what he could to help, including arranging a space for me at work that would eliminate distractions and interruptions. This has most often been a discussion as I would have between friends. Even though we work together, coworkers are often much less formal than management. That makes them more likely to share personal stories."

We should discuss mental health in the same straightforward way we discuss physical health. Talk openly about how mental health, stress reduction, and work life balance are a priority for the company, and then follow through with action. Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all. A coworker and I both struggle with chronic anxiety, and I talked with her a lot right around the time I was starting to go to therapy. She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me. I explained that one of the goals set for me for the coming year (creating a training that involved a great deal of public speaking), created a lot of anxiety for me, and that in fact, I had been struggling with my anxiety for about six months prior to this conversation. My manager was incredibly understanding, and offered me the option to pause any conversations about my professional growth until I was ready to have them. in short, she allowed me to make the decision to ""lean out"" rather than ""lean in"" without any fear of repercussion so I could focus on my mental health, and then return to conversations about how to grow professionally once I decided I was ready."

The coworkers I discussed this with were all very understanding. It was a huge mistake to ever mention my mental health with my supervisors. (This was as a graduate student in materials science.) I was immediately treated differently and with suspicion, subjected to unfair treatment intended to ‘help’ me that made matters much worse, was pressured into letting my supervisors contact my therapist and psychiatrist and ask questions about me, and then fired after my supervisors totally misinterpreted the answers they received. Even the HR department at the university was surprised by how badly they handled it. One of my coworkers has ongoing problems with anxiety and depression. It causes problems with her being able to come to work regularly and we have had several conversations trying to find ways to support her as well as let the team keep working together successfully. It’s a difficult situation with no obvious answers but we are all working together in good faith to get through it. After my experience at my previous job, there’s no way I would discuss my mental health issues with HR or management at a job unless it was completely unavoidable. I have started being more open about it with colleagues because I think it’s helpful for others with mental health issues to see that they are not alone, so we can mutually support each other, but it still scares me a bit."

I've offhandedly mentioned having anxiety and they generally say ""I would have never guessed, you do so well"" and that ends the conversation. For the most part people are very supportive and kind. Some becoming overly problem-solvey. Others try to treat one overly gentle rather than normal with accomodation. See above. It's pretty generically the response.

The process for firing was supposed to be a 3 strikes kind of deal: chat with person above you, written notice you can reply to, firing action. Someone had a chat with me that was positive and talked about me levelling up. The next Monday after that, the head of HR and the head of the head of the whole department were on a surprise Skype call with me at 5 am their time to fire me, because I ""didn't appear happy"". When pressed by lawyers they said they didn't have to provide a reason. If they had done the written bit of their procedure, I could have submitted doctors' notes that I was going through stuff. But I wasn't going to just put that on the table when someone is having a ""casual chat"" about pathways and corrections and stuff, a first time chat. This is tough stuff.

That was about 15 years ago, so take this info with some grand assault. Back in Brazil, 15 years ago, having depression was considered not to be a health issue but mainly a spoiled kid issue. So co-workers would treat bad who had it and who had it wouldn't say because of it. All of this changed now. Mental Health issue is treated with a lot respect in all levels back in Brazil.

It was and still is a good friendship we have. I actually worked for a family owned company, so I discussed my mental health with my uncle, who was my boss, as well as my coworker who was my supervisor. Sometimes I'd need to flex my time to see my therapist, and that was understood. Although, when missing work and saying I'd need a personal day, it was questioned and not taken at face value. A coworker mentioned she was thinking of going to a therapist soon to sort through some worries and things she was feeling anxious about. I encouraged her and just told her my experiences in therapy. In my previous job, getting questioned for the reason for taking personal days was a big thing. As well as the ability to work from home.

First, what could we do to ensure he got the help he needed, and second, what did we have to do at the office to mitigate the reputational and other damage caused by him having a dramatic episode in the office. We did those things, he did get help, and took about a month leave of absence.

In other fields, these types of mental disorders are typically seen as weaknesses.  In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges. For classification purposes - I am a mid-40's male, with diagnosed anxiety and ADD.   I have done extensive research which leads me to strongly suspect that I am in the high-functioning end of the Asperger's spectrum.

Employers can assist folks with resources, but employees are accountable for accessing those resources to keep themselves healthy enough to perform their job functions. If these resources aren't enough, then employees need to feel comfortable moving on to more accommodating arrangements for themselves. Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial. I have seen some unsupportive managers in the past who lacked empathy for mental health issues. I have related my anxiety and depression related issues with coworkers. I have discussed anxiety and depression with my employer. I have also discussed bereavement related issues and related leave. Positive reactions to discussions of depression. Many coworkers have discussed many mental health issues with me, including anxiety, depression, bereavement related issues, and medical related mental health issues. Ideally all of the arrangements for a person's health will be removed from the employer - employee relationship. It can only end in the creation of dependent relationships that are unhealthy for both parties."

I have also been bullied by another boss and a manager at a small transportation company, Riolo Transportation (based in Carlsbad, CA) where they told me that since I had PTSD, they were unsure if they could trust me to do work. I don't see how either of those things correspond to each other, especially how I was a great worker and never caused any issues (if I made a mistake, I owned up to it and fixed it). I quit on the spot and they cussed me out. They became some of my closest friends after I disclosed to them that I suffer from PTSD. I discussed my mental health with my previous company (Applied Predictive Technologies) and they used it against me. Any time I needed to go home early due to sickness, HR would ask if it was physical or mental. When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!) I had no choice but to put in my two weeks shortly after I came back, to which they told me to pack up and leave. I was not respected at APT, and I would like for someone to look into this, if possible. I tried to report them, but my mental health issues were so bad, I could not handle the stress that reporting them would give me.

People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work. I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...) I think I gave the tech sector 3 stars for dealing with mental illness, but I came to tech from the nonprofit sector and I would give them 1 star and that would be generous. Tech is fucking heaven compared to nonprofit work, where remote work is unheard of, benefits and wages are skimpy, and self-sacrifice is the name of the game."

In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy. In discussing our workload, my coworker and I have talked about how we fit in to the current environment, and how stressful it feels to be left out of certain conversations, both in person and electronically. The conversation's purpose was definitely to vent - she and I both shared similar feelings, and were able to confide in one another in a meaningful way. See answer to letter O."

Having the ability to disconnect from being responsible 24/7 for the health and wellbeing of a computer service is important.

The best thing I've gotten is being in a results-based work flow. I'm not required to be at work at a time, but to get work done. This allows me to have my own Self-Care moments or days without worrying about not being ""there"" for work. The only event that comes to mind is a previous co-worker talking about their inability to believe that depression is a thing. It was hard for me to understand their stance. 

There may have been other circumstances but I do not recall them at this time. I have had some open and honest conversations about what I've gone through mentally as it pertains to my job functions and getting through life. The reactions were generally accepting and positive. Contextually, we both work on the community team and it was during travel and not official ""work"" time. This was during the same conversation sharing our own experiences Overall, I think I am well accepted at the place I work now, but that it is a rare place in the startup world and in the world in general. I'd be much more comfortable talking to this workplace about mental health issues than any other workplace so far. Previous work places includeded US Government, Metal (like steel/aluminum) company, and a small business. Being on a ""community"" team could affect that as well.

I had to tell my manager that my psychiatrist was putting me on a three-month leave for severe depression and anxiety, so I could attend a partial hospitalization program. He was neutrally supportive but clearly uncomfortable with the topic. After a large layoff in 2002, a group of four of us on the same team were affected with MH problems.

Another company, during a divorce with my first wife, I became quite depressed and it was starting to impact my performance, attendance, etc. The manager of that company sat me down and asked how he could personally help.

When I discussed issues with managers and requested moving to another team, they refused. After numerous conversations with HR I finally got a new manager but this did not resolve other incompetencies with management and the business strategy. I was told I could ask a dr for a note to use my sick time to recover. I was not given the option to take medical leave or short term disability for the back pain that was so severe I couldn’t stand up straight one day, and had to go home early several times. Eventually the back pain got bad enough I decided to quit the job and be unemployed rather than continue to suffer. I talked about dealing with depression from loss of a pet as well as an emotionally abusive relationship and then Trump being elected.

Work medical leave into scheduling. Work sick days into scheduling. Encourage people to talk about how they navigate their tendencies in order to ease into discussions about navigating and mitigating disorders. A manager failed to apprise an employee of the availability of medical leave when the employee  was experiencing an extended depressive episode resulting from medication changes. This, combined with the manager switching him from project to project rapidly and not being able to demonstrate execution of work tasks effectively, resulted in that manager firing the employee because of underperformance and erratic behavior instead of a more proper approach: take some time off. We talked about burnout because I took a Friday afternoon off after working ~44 hours during the first four days of the week. They agreed that I'd done enough work for the week. We talked about burnout a lot as well as unhappiness and hopelessness in relationships. One employee had recently relocated and the move was very stressful because of leaving a childhood home city and realizing she was not going to see some friends again ever. The greatest point of stress in managing people with mental health issues is managing up. How can I tell my boss that someone needs to take a week off because they dealt with self-harmful thoughts all weekend? I like to think that I'm a pretty woke boss but I don't know if my boss and their boss are as accommodating, understanding, and empathetic to the individual in the face of ""if we don't ship this feature we will literally go bankrupt"". Because that's the pressure I'm under right now.

Ultimately, anyone who's not pulling their weight is a liability. If someone's health, physical or mental, is impacting the business's ability to survive, when should the business sever the relationship?

Moreover, when does extreme productivity that turns into burnout become exploitative? I want to see more discussion and safeguards around that. I'm a workaholic that has realized that I've relapsed and I can't shake it because I've overcommitted. I'm able but it's going to take a toll on me, physically and mentally, until the crunch is over. But the crunch might not be over until the year is over…"

Recently a coworker was willing to talk about childhood trauma regarding seeing a psychiatrist that makes them not want to see one now. 

Another coworker made people uncomfortable by publicly talking way too much about his mental health. It was impossible to have a normal conversation with him without it veering into therapy for him. I think it's made a lot of my teammates uncomfortable talking about mental health issues."

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources. Lead by example. Mentally healthy supervisors help foster mentally healthy employees. We spoke about depression and how it can impact our work.

I have seen some companies attempt to mitigate the effects by giving the employee(s) a day off at the end of the oncall rotation, or offering at least comp time for any off hour outages, but some standards like these being published so they can be referenced by other IT professionals would go a long way as a tool to those attempting to improve the situation from within their organizations.

I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it. I've only had surface level conversations, more so feeling out their situation and understanding of mental health and mental health issues. Discussed Anxiaty disorder and how my previous job negatively effected it and my overall health/happyness. My employer was understanding of the situation. I did not request any action to be taken nor did they offer. We agreed to just be upfront and honest in our communication. I shared with my closes employees as sometimes my anxiaty would make me shut down and become unavailable for a day when they needed to contact me. They were supportive. Unfortuately I waited until I was at the breaking point and needed to quit.  My supervisor was willing to put me on Medical leave for a period of time but I declined. It's only as I've gotten older that I'm accepted that help is required for some (if not all) things in life and there is no shame in leaning on others. I felt relieved when I found out others in my life had similar mental health issues as I do. Knowing that them just telling me they are dealing with something make an impact on me, made me feel more open about sharing myself.

Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills. My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee. The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently. When I was diagnosed with ADHD and began treatment, I discussed it with my boss and supervisor. At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed. We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it. I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial. I like to think that I've helped my superiors become more willing to accept my differences (and hopefully others'), and find the unique values that an ADHD brain can bring."

Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized. Really just in passing a few times, no particular reaction. You are responsible for your own healthcare in my country, your employer has nothing to do with it."

We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate.

First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me.

One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor. Thank you, I really needed this survey. Love you all ❤️"

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness. They were my coworkers but they are my friends, so the talks were very productive and they were/are supportive. As simple as it could be I was direct and, at that moment I was ok, if I was fired, and said that I needed therapy and probably treatment for my stress level. He was ok with (as even if it wasn't ok, he didn't have an option) and from the therapist, I was directed to a doctor and got treated. A solid great decision that helped me extremely."

Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder. The context was a meeting between several coworkers, including one who was suffering greatly from anxiety, which was impeding her work. I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me. It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship. As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself. I considered trying to explain but didn’t think I would be able to."

I made decisions about which coworkers to discuss mental health with, but I have had conversations over lunch (off-site) about periodic anxiety, as well as conversations with some of my team mates about my misophonia as it has impacts on my focus and concentration in meetings so I like to make people aware of it so I can ask for accommodations when needed.

When it became apparent that I have anxiety, and it was interfering with my ability to complete tasks, my boss put me on a PIP that was impossible to achieve. I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with. Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep? My supervisor was dumbfounded the first time he observed me during a (job-related) anxiety attack when I completely forgot how to do something simple and routine. He spent two hours asking me leading questions to help me solve my problem instead of gently reminding me. I thought I was going to cry. He said ""what can I do to help you"", made a few suggestions, faked empathy. And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully. Discussing imposter syndrome, feeling like you can't take a break, nothing gets done fast enough.
The response from my coworker was a lot of ""oh yea, me too"" Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it. I had no idea at the time that this is anxiety. I'm sure my boss knew. my coworker/good friend was describing how sad she was feeling after several traumatic events in rapid succession and bad turn of events at work. I finally said, ""This is my therapist's number, call her and ask about happy pills. I take them, they help me. I hope they help you too."""

Work/life balance is tough to achieve, and work and life are not inherently separate, but priorities and boundaries need to be set. I told my team lead that I was feeling overwhelmed. He told me to take the rest of the day off (and the next one if I wanted), and reminded me that we have mental health services available. I had a coworker confide in me that her manager was being unnecessarily overbearing and that the team wasn't sharing the workload equally. I suggested we get lunch outside of work, and there I asked if she was looking to move to a different team (I'm familiar with the team she was currently on). She has moved to a different team and says she is much more content."

There was a strong sense of questioning my fitness for that career, which contributed to a shift in career. The failure of leadership to provide meaningful help in that case was very distressing. I talk about my mental health with co-workers frequently, in my role as a chapter leader for the employee resource group devoted to supporting employees with MHIs and MHDs. Reactions have overall been very positive and affirming, and sometimes curious or in need. I've talked a bit with my manager about my neurodivergence (ADHD) and its impacts, and have offered to be a resource on these issues for my team. I'm also a chapter leader in our employee resource group for folks with mental health issues and disorders My previous career was not necessarily in tech, and was very supportive of mental health, in general. My co-workers and I discussed it extensively, and were very supportive of one another. I was struggling mightily, pre-diagnosis. I was encouraged by my employer to seek treatment, and provided generous resources for doing so. I have sometimes provided support for co-workers struggling with their mental health. They have generally been grateful or appreciative of having someone around who ""gets it."" I hope that your work will start to include some of the conversation around neurodiversity, and that we can build more bridges around those ideas!"

I told my knew direct report that I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and depression. I wanted to make him aware because I focus so much on hiding it that impairs me and makes me less engaged at work and instead I am accepting, acknowledging and sharing with him because it is very real. I also asked if we could do a 5 min mental health check in on our 1 on 1 weekly to hold myself accountable. He thought it was a great idea but rather we do it separately from our 1 on 1 to give me 15 min rather than 5. It helped me so much just by breaking the silence. I talked about my substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety. I had a mental health break down while I was working at my previous employer (food and beverage). I told them I was quitting and instead said I could take the time I needed and come back when I was ready. Once I was open with my struggles, others opened up to me.

Once I had to advocate for myself in regards to my anxiety, and they were very accommodating. They related to what I was telling them and asked some questions to understand. I was in a difficult situation where the clinic where I was being treated for my eating disorder had changed its clinical model, making me ineligible for care. 

I was dealing with a lot of stress and sat down with my boss to let him know what was going on.

He was very supportive, telling me to take the time I needed to get things sorted out, and let me cry in his office.

I felt very supported and safe. At one job I told a coworker about how the work was negatively affecting my mental health. She was very concerned and encouraged me to reach out to my boss/HR and to seek help. She was very supportive, even if the environment we were in was not. When first entering treatment for my eating disorder I told my boss that I was taking the day off for a medical intake. She asked what kind of intake.

I wasn't really comfortable talking about it with her, but told her anyway because I was worried it would look badly to not share.

She became very awkward and stiff. A coworker once confided in me about some struggles he was going through with his depression, and we talked about it together and went over some strategies. I mostly just listened and gave him support."

So I only opened up about the disorder/disorders I  have after I left the job a couple of years ago. PS. Since there was no option in the survey to be on benefit support I chose to write about my last employment. Already mentioned. I do not think they took much note of the mental disorders, as I usually did not talk about them much. They spoke of their own depression and it seemed to me that it was to elicit my own story so that I would open up. I saw little point in that. Another time I struck up a short lived friendship and lost it as I moved jobs.
There have been numerous times when I have been taken advantage of financially by employers."

I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis. My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation. This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally. I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness. My office visit was in network if I saw a doctor without a MH specialty to prescribe my medication, but was out-of network if I saw a psychiatrist or other provider who specialized in mental health"

They responded with genuine concern and understanding without bombarding me with questions. They really helped normalize the whole experience.

I've since opened up to even more of my coworkers and each time it becomes a little easier and feels a little lighter. Physical health issues can be harder to hide and are generally more understood. There are also long-standing protections for employees with physical health issues. I would be very hesitant. Many people do not understand mental health and might assume it means I would be unpredictable. It is also very taxing to have to explain and focus on my mental health issues, especially in a new environment where I may not feel safe and supported.

But there are a lot of people in the office that I wouldn’t want to discuss it with. I feel like anything could be seen as a reason not to hire someone or as an excuse to do less work. But then again I also feel like it must be illegal to not hire someone based on physical health issues. They would have to be really showing that they get it for me to do that. Most employers would view that negatively / would be less likely to hire me I think. I don’t want to be seen as someone who is weak or making excuses. This needs to change. Seriously, we need to give people sick AND mental health paid time off SEPARATE from vacation pto. We should not have to choose between vacation and mental health days. Managers need to be trained to understand mental health. They need to understand that if you feel like shit sitting at your desk and trying to force yourself to work will only make things worse and won’t help the employee OR THE COMPANY"

Preventative care and normalizing struggle. I think as a society we have this aversion to being uncomfortable and we pathologize natural human experience. In tech, there's this constant drive for ""bigger, stronger, faster"" which now is becoming increasingly offset with these crash vacations of nothingness. There's no balance. Not to mention the isolation and lack of routine and connection that so many in tech deal with. Intense pressure on deliverables.

Just because you have mental illness, does not mean ytou are resigned to a life that is sad, disconnected, difficult, or unprosperous. People need to understand that talking about these perceptions are the only way to change them. 2021-01-31 19:29:40 2021-01-31 20:05:23 683905c16b"

Indifference I had weekly in-person sessions pre-COVID and had to request time off. Unfortunately, I ran out of PTO, so I had to meet with our benefits administrator to discuss my options that didn't interfere with the work day. My teammates also lived with a mental illness, so it was nice knowing that I could be open with them and them with me. We were able to talk through things if we needed to. Understanding. Active listening. Empathy. Add additional mental health resources to health benefits that aren't an EAP. For example, employees at my previous employer had difficulty finding providers that accepted our insurance, so they defaulted to ""they can use their FSA/HSA to cover the cost"" or ""they can utilize their fringe benefits."" And, of course, suggesting using our EAP. There needs to be a more open discussion about living with a mental illness, especially from the top. Create an environment where folx feel comfortable talking about their feelings - practicing psychological safety and active listening."

I'm not sure how we can strike a balance of both being supportive, and having comfortable professional boundaries. No, I thought this survey was interesting, and actually made me reflect on my own views and made me realize that I am less comfortable discussing mental health issues than I thought, I might workplace is less comfortable discussing mental health issues and I thought. I think a survey similar to this could have the impact, beyond gathering information, of helping companies and individuals perform that self-reflection about their views on mental health. That self reflection is a starting point for change."

I am pursuing a start up because I am left feeling unhirable and unable to trust bureaucracies i don’t have a hand in creating, 25 years into my career"

They were very supportive and when I made the decision to terminate my employment (I was missing a fair amount of work because of my condition), we parted on very good terms. Just that I was struggling and wanted them to pray for me, to which they assured me they would and continued to be very supportive.
