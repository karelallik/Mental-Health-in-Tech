Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out. I was at one time berated to the point of experiencing a dissociative episode while sitting in my supervisor's office with a coworker present. When I later confronted the coworker about this, they did not apologize. Also, due to symptoms earlier in the year, I experienced a lapse in performance for one week (the consequences of which were minor). As a result of this I am currently being singled out and micromanaged and my behavior in the office policed, in addition to (at least the perception of) being gaslit by my current supervisor, who ""could not"" supply concrete evidence of my lack of performance. I've unofficially disclosed diagnoses to coworkers. They haven't said anything about them to me since. One coworker in particular has been told about 3 or 4 times about a particular diagnosis and seems to have selective memory about it. ""I am not your therapist."" (This happens any time I mention any symptom. I do my best not to, but at times it is impossible.) The coworker was very supportive and did their best to help me. My supervisor was outwardly understanding at first but the situation eventually became discriminatory in nature A coworker has told me over drinks that she worked out a plan with our direct supervisor for how to manage some of her symptoms.

I told a previous coworker who I was in a relationship with about my mental health issues. He took that opportunity to try to force me to see his therapist, and used my mental health issues as a way to isolate me from the rest of our coworkers and to attempt to control me. This is a large factor in why I left my previous job and am reluctant to discuss my mental health with current coworkers and supervisors. Coworkers occasionally gossip about other people's mental health. I try not to participate in this, and am likely to cut someone off if they behave this way. As such, I'm fairly certain that some of my coworkers gossip about my mental health behind my back. A large barrier to mental health treatment is that insurance is rather tepid on the whole issue.

The next step imo would be more public awareness of effective treatment options: we start to recognise we (collectively) can have problems, next question is what do we do about them? Because I have a family history of serious mental illness known to have a heritable component, I asked my manager to be alert during my performance reviews for signs of abnormal behavior. He responded that he is not a doctor and I should seek professional help if I have specific concerns, but that he would bear it in mind. No specific actions were taken. When I was having difficulty sleeping I discussed this with colleagues. They commiserated but the general sense was that this is part of the job. Due to deadline pressure and off-hours outage response I was having difficulty sleeping. My manager decided that this was a bridge too far and took over outage responses to reduce my stress level. A colleague undergoing treatment for depression discussed his situation with me, talking about how he felt and what treatment options he was exploring.",Male

My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased. This was at a previous employer. In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc. In Slack, a coworker stated he was depressed and needed the teams help understanding that. It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for).",Female

Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to. Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress. I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan.

I told my employer about my trouble focusing and my diagnosis of anxiety and ADD. He was very understanding, and did not press the issue allowing me to open up as much so wanted. He really made me feel comfortable talking with him. A co-worker told me about their experience with depression and how they try to cope with it.

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health. For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.  My current employer from the creation of the company has emphasized the importance of mental health and those values stayed with the company as we've grown.,Female

My VP of Engineering called me out in the team Slack for having problems with noise, then in person in the office. I usually explain that I have GAD and it's well-managed but if I need to leave a meeting or use an anxiety app on my phone, it isn't because I'm just up and out.

There was a time when the department head (VP of Engineering) called me out in our team Slack for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and offering me first choice of seating (changing the office layout). That was then ignored by a few of my coworkers, which prompted the VPE to make an issue of it directly in the office. All I could do was stare at the floor.

My immediate supervisor knows and has been supportive and attentive. He doesn't always understand but he always believes me. He has made several requests on my behalf for accommodations that have been ignored across the board. Because of that, I do not feel comfortable talking about it with anyone higher than he is.
There have also been times when our department manager has called me out publicly (to the team) for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and made a big deal about arranging The previous VP Engineering was himself familiar with mental health issues and was open and understanding. I brought up my anxiety and he did what he could to help, including arranging a space for me at work that would eliminate distractions and interruptions.

We should discuss mental health in the same straightforward way we discuss physical health. Talk openly about how mental health, stress reduction, and work life balance are a priority for the company, and then follow through with action. Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all. A coworker and I both struggle with chronic anxiety, and I talked with her a lot right around the time I was starting to go to therapy. She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me. I explained that one of the goals set for me for the coming year (creating a training that involved a great deal of public speaking), created a lot of anxiety for me, and that in fact, I had been struggling with my anxiety for about six months prior to this conversation. My manager was incredibly understanding, and offered me the option to pause any conversations about my professional growth until I was ready to have them. in short, she allowed me to make the decision to ""lean out"" rather than ""lean in"" without any fear of repercussion so I could focus on my mental health, and then return to conversations about how to grow professionally once I decided I was ready.",Female

As employers seek to reduce health insurance plan costs, and as more and more employers only offer HDHPs, they should consider the option of front-loading employee's HSA/HRA plans or wellness incentives so that employees with mental health issues don't have to go through the choice of poverty vs Health while they try to meet their deductible, or the humiliation of asking for a pay advance so they can cover their bills. I used to have a very stressful, highly visible, and thankless job, which gave me a lot of anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. I spoke frequently to a coworker who had a similar position to mine, and we often discussed the impact of this work on our state of mind.

Sometimes I'd need to flex my time to see my therapist, and that was understood. Although, when missing work and saying I'd need a personal day, it was questioned and not taken at face value. A coworker mentioned she was thinking of going to a therapist soon to sort through some worries and things she was feeling anxious about. I encouraged her and just told her my experiences in therapy. In my previous job, getting questioned for the reason for taking personal days was a big thing. As well as the ability to work from home. I think these things are really important, especially for those working in tech jobs, to feel that they are trusted by their employer and that they are supported by their employer. I think it comes down to healthy and effective communication, check ins and removing ambiguity around what is or isn't allowed.",Female

In other fields, these types of mental disorders are typically seen as weaknesses.  In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges. For classification purposes - I am a mid-40's male, with diagnosed anxiety and ADD.   I have done extensive research which leads me to strongly suspect that I am in the high-functioning end of the Asperger's spectrum.  Being high-functioning, I have progressed professionally into a management position for both technical and non-technical areas or responsibility.

Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial.

Let's all download Stop, Breathe, Think on Slack and meditate together. I have been told by HR to never disclose it with anyone. I have also been bullied by another boss and a manager at a small transportation company, Riolo Transportation (based in Carlsbad, CA) where they told me that since I had PTSD, they were unsure if they could trust me to do work. I don't see how either of those things correspond to each other, especially how I was a great worker and never caused any issues (if I made a mistake, I owned up to it and fixed it). I quit on the spot and they cussed me out. They became some of my closest friends after I disclosed to them that I suffer from PTSD. I discussed my mental health with my previous company (Applied Predictive Technologies) and they used it against me. Any time I needed to go home early due to sickness, HR would ask if it was physical or mental. When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!) I had no choice but to put in my two weeks shortly after I came back, to which they told me to pack up and leave. I was not respected at APT, and I would like for someone to look into this, if possible. I tried to report them, but my mental health issues were so bad, I could not handle the stress that reporting them would give me.

Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes. A coworker disclosed that they had ADHD when their cubicle was moved to a very busy and loud area of the office.  They had difficulty concentrating with the commotion around them and disclosed their ADHD (oh, totally forgot to mention this person when I talked about mental healthy convos with coworkers, anyway) to the employer and they rejected her request for an accommodation (a move to a quieter spot in the office) until they rephrased their request in formal, written terms that belied that they knew that the employer could be in violation of ADA by not accommodating them. After the accommodation was made, this person was labeled a trouble-maker by the executive staff and a careful, strategic effort was made to push this person out. Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews. They saw the writing on the wall and found employment elsewhere.  This person has recently received a lot of visibility for their success - they also now work remotely - so this is very much a success is the best revenge story. STILL. I've talked with my coworkers about my mental health on more than one occasion. I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment. Has to be the right person at the right time and sometimes I worry I overshare. But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding. I have openly discussed my struggles with anxiety and complex PTSD with my team, including my supervisor. I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work. I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...) I think I gave the tech sector 3 stars for dealing with mental illness, but I came to tech from the nonprofit sector and I would give them 1 star and that would be generous. Tech is fucking heaven compared to nonprofit work, where remote work is unheard of, benefits and wages are skimpy, and self-sacrifice is the name of the game.",Female

Another coworker discussed a substance abuse issue being experienced by one of her direct reports with me, she reports to me. Her direct report didn't want anyone to know that he was entering rehab for alcohol a second time. My direct report felt powerless and upset by the situation.",Female

My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job.

We also have a mental health channel in our Slack. He'd been only coming to my desk to criticise my work, and we hadn't had a non-work related chat in a while. I let him know that as I suffer from depression with a side plate of SAD, I was struggling with this kind of interaction and I needed more praise/positive attention. He was very understanding and changed his actions accordingly. I was suffering from a major depressive episode while working in retail, lots of my coworkers realised it before I did and reached out to check if I was okay Many conversations, often. Not sleeping well because of anxiety, having had to take leave at their last place because of anxiety and depression etc. And we have a mental-health channel on Slack to discuss day-to-day mental health. I'm from the UK, which is fairly different (since we don't have health insurance)",Female

I had to tell my manager that my psychiatrist was putting me on a three-month leave for severe depression and anxiety, so I could attend a partial hospitalization program. He was neutrally supportive but clearly uncomfortable with the topic. After a large layoff in 2002, a group of four of us on the same team were affected with MH problems.

Work medical leave into scheduling. Work sick days into scheduling. Encourage people to talk about how they navigate their tendencies in order to ease into discussions about navigating and mitigating disorders. A manager failed to apprise an employee of the availability of medical leave when the employee  was experiencing an extended depressive episode resulting from medication changes. This, combined with the manager switching him from project to project rapidly and not being able to demonstrate execution of work tasks effectively, resulted in that manager firing the employee because of underperformance and erratic behavior instead of a more proper approach: take some time off. We talked about burnout because I took a Friday afternoon off after working ~44 hours during the first four days of the week. They agreed that I'd done enough work for the week. We talked about burnout a lot as well as unhappiness and hopelessness in relationships. One employee had recently relocated and the move was very stressful because of leaving a childhood home city and realizing she was not going to see some friends again ever. The greatest point of stress in managing people with mental health issues is managing up. How can I tell my boss that someone needs to take a week off because they dealt with self-harmful thoughts all weekend? I like to think that I'm a pretty woke boss but I don't know if my boss and their boss are as accommodating, understanding, and empathetic to the individual in the face of ""if we don't ship this feature we will literally go bankrupt"". Because that's the pressure I'm under right now.

Ultimately, anyone who's not pulling their weight is a liability. If someone's health, physical or mental, is impacting the business's ability to survive, when should the business sever the relationship?

Moreover, when does extreme productivity that turns into burnout become exploitative? I want to see more discussion and safeguards around that.

He recently got convicted of her murder after three years of trial and prosecution. Same discussion as I had with my direct manager: openness to depression, PPD, and substance abuse from emotional stress and abusive relationships in high school. I told my direct manager that I had suffered from PPD and had a history of depression when I was younger. I also told her that I had a history of substance abuse and sought treatment twice for my condition. Both times in high school. Mental health is considered taboo in many Asian cultures. Growing up, I was told that depression was a myth that white Americans make up as an excuse to be lazy or weak. ""Talking about feelings"" was reserved for weak women. And finally, men who show emotion are not fit to be leaders and caring parents by some of these cultural views.",Female

Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills. My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee. The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently. When I was diagnosed with ADHD and began treatment, I discussed it with my boss and supervisor. At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed. We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it. I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial.

Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized. Really just in passing a few times, no particular reaction. You are responsible for your own healthcare in my country, your employer has nothing to do with it.",Female

But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue. One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions.

A friend of mine committed suicide and when I quit my job right after, my former boss said that I was going to do the same. I like that this question is framed in the singular, that's the response that sticks out but I'm sure there's others. I had other coworkers with mental health issues. Sometimes it was explaining that non veterans can have PTSD. A few people knew I was going to therapy regularly. I was dealing with a poor work environment and a lot of microaggressions/overt sexism and ableism from the C level of the startup I was at. It was making my PTSD worse. I went to HR but she couldn't do anything. She was mostly concerned I might sue over things that had happened. I ended up leaving on disability before I quit completely.

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness. They were my coworkers but they are my friends, so the talks were very productive and they were/are supportive. As simple as it could be I was direct and, at that moment I was ok, if I was fired, and said that I needed therapy and probably treatment for my stress level. He was ok with (as even if it wasn't ok, he didn't have an option) and from the therapist, I was directed to a doctor and got treated. A solid great decision that helped me extremely.",Male

Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder. The context was a meeting between several coworkers, including one who was suffering greatly from anxiety, which was impeding her work. I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me. It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship. As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself. I considered trying to explain but didn’t think I would be able to.",Non-binary

However, when the director met with me for an evaluation, he addressed some concerns around breaks I was taking.  It was at this point I shared with him the conversations I had with the other two staff members and how I was addressing these gaps with their support.  His response was ""well while I appreciate the whole depression thing, you have to do your job"" and from that point forward, I found him treating me differently, for example, scheduling a meeting for a day when I was taking PTO where he shared information that directly impacted my team. I made decisions about which coworkers to discuss mental health with, but I have had conversations over lunch (off-site) about periodic anxiety, as well as conversations with some of my team mates about my misophonia as it has impacts on my focus and concentration in meetings so I like to make people aware of it so I can ask for accommodations when needed.

All this happened AFTER the company I worked for had their annual ""year start"" gathering in SFO. When it became apparent that I have anxiety, and it was interfering with my ability to complete tasks, my boss put me on a PIP that was impossible to achieve. I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with. Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep? My supervisor was dumbfounded the first time he observed me during a (job-related) anxiety attack when I completely forgot how to do something simple and routine. He spent two hours asking me leading questions to help me solve my problem instead of gently reminding me. I thought I was going to cry. He said ""what can I do to help you"", made a few suggestions, faked empathy. And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully. Discussing imposter syndrome, feeling like you can't take a break, nothing gets done fast enough.
The response from my coworker was a lot of ""oh yea, me too"" Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it. I had no idea at the time that this is anxiety. I'm sure my boss knew. my coworker/good friend was describing how sad she was feeling after several traumatic events in rapid succession and bad turn of events at work.

I was dealing with a lot of stress and sat down with my boss to let him know what was going on.

He was very supportive, telling me to take the time I needed to get things sorted out, and let me cry in his office.

I felt very supported and safe. At one job I told a coworker about how the work was negatively affecting my mental health. She was very concerned and encouraged me to reach out to my boss/HR and to seek help. She was very supportive, even if the environment we were in was not.

I wasn't really comfortable talking about it with her, but told her anyway because I was worried it would look badly to not share.

It appeared that they were not very well informed about the issues and yet there was some understanding. I chose to reveal the extent of my problems slowly. I also only spoke about these to my direct superior leaving other coworkers somewhat in the dark and not discussing about my disorder and any mental aspects with them. They seemed to have a hunch that something was wrong, though. 
So I only opened up about the disorder/disorders I  have after I left the job a couple of years ago. PS. Since there was no option in the survey to be on benefit support I chose to write about my last employment. Already mentioned. I do not think they took much note of the mental disorders, as I usually did not talk about them much. They spoke of their own depression and it seemed to me that it was to elicit my own story so that I would open up. I saw little point in that. Another time I struck up a short lived friendship and lost it as I moved jobs.
There have been numerous times when I have been taken advantage of financially by employers.",Male

I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis. My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation. This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally. I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness. My office visit was in network if I saw a doctor without a MH specialty to prescribe my medication, but was out-of network if I saw a psychiatrist or other provider who specialized in mental health",Female
