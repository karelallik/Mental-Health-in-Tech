Some types of healthcare, including mental health, are still funded from the government budget, but that doesn't matter, it's still FREE!

You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. 

In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(

I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication.

2014,"I answered based on previous job at large technical company, where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.

I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope, I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) ""deserved"" stress was anxiety, caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing, I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.

It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing), I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.

Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:
1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day, four years later, despite being ""stable"" I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that, it would be seen as ""oh, I'm sorry"". I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.
2) Accomodations.
- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead, they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily, as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive, unnecessary appointment).
- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open, but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up, but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.
- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits, as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR, I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and ""putting on my dick hat"" to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling, and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package, I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being ""medically disqualified from this role"". I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.",,1

Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that. Yet sometimes I wan't to tell everyone what I've been through and share my lessons learned.",,1

2014,"I burnt out this year. I worked too much, had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.

I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating, sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work, couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.

My employers response, after a while, was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor, which my employer agreed to, only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent, bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat, gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.

I had previously been told by my employer that I ""was too young to burn out"" and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to ""get myself together"" and ultimately, given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer, left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.",,1

2014,"My mental health issues were the direct result of the trauma from childhood abuse. Most (all?) of the Prompt-sponsored/related presentations I've seen have been about congenital mental health issues that are treatable with continued medication. For me, medication only provided temporary assistance. I needed years of (continuing) therapy to deal with PTSD and related disorders (depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, others). I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues, but they are just as real and just as debilitating.",,1

2014,"Although my employer does everything they can to accommodate employees with mental health problems, when those individuals cannot carry out any work assigned to them (even over the course of months) they appear to have no alternative but to terminate their employment.

Several times I've seen people with depression or other mental problems be fired rather then the employer be supportive and try to deal with/help that person. People with mental disorders can be just as productive as any other worker. They just need to be dealt with in a different manner. Saying the least negative thing to them, which to you is nothing, can devastate their entire mental being. Most of us evaluate our self worth on how well we do our job and if were told were doing a bad job we feel useless.

We became good friends, that person is one of the nicest I've ever met, and their openness made me feel I can trust them and share information about my life too.

Consider offering sparkling cider and other non-alcoholic, non-water beverages at your next meetup.

Very few companies offer employees time during work hours to take care of personal things. Most doctors do not work outside business hours, it is hard to go to therapy and have a full time job. Someone was more timid than others as a result of some social anxiety. This person was male and ridiculed relentlessly.

Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out. I was at one time berated to the point of experiencing a dissociative episode while sitting in my supervisor's office with a coworker present. When I later confronted the coworker about this, they did not apologize. Also, due to symptoms earlier in the year, I experienced a lapse in performance for one week (the consequences of which were minor). As a result of this I am currently being singled out and micromanaged and my behavior in the office policed, in addition to (at least the perception of) being gaslit by my current supervisor, who ""could not"" supply concrete evidence of my lack of performance. I've unofficially disclosed diagnoses to coworkers. They haven't said anything about them to me since. One coworker in particular has been told about 3 or 4 times about a particular diagnosis and seems to have selective memory about it. ""I am not your therapist."" (This happens any time I mention any symptom. I do my best not to, but at times it is impossible.) The coworker was very supportive and did their best to help me. My supervisor was outwardly understanding at first but the situation eventually became discriminatory in nature A coworker has told me over drinks that she worked out a plan with our direct supervisor for how to manage some of her symptoms.

They operated with US employment policies rather than EU. I was in threatening situations (being yelled at in front of colleagues) and constantly under enormous stress. I wasn't treated until after I lost my job. It was pretty bad. We spoke about being burnt out. And the irony of the ""take it when you want to"" vacation policy which meant that no one took vacation. It was sick, we knew it, but we kept on. A few days after my father died, my boss told me to ""compartmentalize"" and just get back to work. In the previous six months, I had lost 3 other close relatives and had a miscarriage. I was demented with depression and never took the time off I needed.

Far too many of us suffer in silence because despite this common experience we share, the stigmas are so powerful that we can't openly discuss the situation, demand better treatment from our superiors, or fully disclose our condition when applying for jobs. After disclosing my mental illness to an employer, the immediate response was for them to yell ""I don't want to hear any excuses!"" and dismiss the idea of any accommodations outright. They let me go shortly thereafter. I've only ever confided in a select few coworkers who I trusted would handle my mental illness in confidence and with respect. Otherwise, I would not disclose my mental illness in a workplace environment for fear of retaliation. I've disclosed my mental health state many times as a result of its impact affecting me negatively. The response has been mixed. By superiors who knew me directly, the response was positive; by the company at large and human resources, the response was negative, as if I had suddenly become a ""burden"" to the company, and as if there was now an impetus on the company to find an engineer with my skillset but without my mental illness.

As previously mentioned, my coworker, who was more senior, used this as an opportunity to isolate me from the rest of the team, negatively impact my performance reviews, and abuse me in a relationship. We have a support slack group for people living with mental illness, and a couple select coworkers and I hold each other accountable for self care, as we all have mental health issues that we deal with. I've mentioned, in vague terms, that I'm having mental health issues when things have gotten particularly bad. This has been helpful in requesting more structure when I'm feeling unmoored as a result of my mental illness. I told a previous coworker who I was in a relationship with about my mental health issues. He took that opportunity to try to force me to see his therapist, and used my mental health issues as a way to isolate me from the rest of our coworkers and to attempt to control me. This is a large factor in why I left my previous job and am reluctant to discuss my mental health with current coworkers and supervisors. Coworkers occasionally gossip about other people's mental health. I try not to participate in this, and am likely to cut someone off if they behave this way. As such, I'm fairly certain that some of my coworkers gossip about my mental health behind my back. A large barrier to mental health treatment is that insurance is rather tepid on the whole issue.

2017,"The values of the tech industry are very much focused on day-to-day productivity, which can be very difficult for people with mental health issues.

This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others. Not a response as such, but a previous manager made some derogatory comments about sufferers of ADHD that made me unwilling to open up to him when I was experiencing difficulties.

I have talked about depression, anxiety, and ADHD with previous coworkers.

Things like ""You're crazy"" when you do something silly or say something weird for example. There is no bad intent with it, but it is still a potentially destructive word to someone struggling, especially silently. I believe education is the largest thing that could help, but instituting mental health awareness and general assistance programs could also go a long way. I am very close to people on my team and sometimes we do discuss mental health issues. From my experience they are understanding and not hostile. I had a very close relationship with my boss and we were able to discuss all sorts of mental health and related issues. He was very supportive.

I have also worked as a server, a pizza maker, and a stripper. We need to remember that as much as it sucks to have mental illness within the tech industry, we're actually really privileged to work for employers that typically pay us living wages and provide us health insurance. Up until I became a programmer, most of my employers & supervisors would've just told me to kick rocks and grow up if I had mentioned my mental health troubles. Things could be a lot worse.

It was rather dry, and mostly focused around whether or not it was burn out and if I needed minimal time off to recover. We were discussing seasonal affected disorder and talking about how it has more effect on us. They mentioned that they have a condition that causes them problems with the season and time change.

2017,"I think this depends on the company. My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased. This was at a previous employer. In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc. In Slack, a coworker stated he was depressed and needed the teams help understanding that. It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for).

Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress. I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan.

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.

To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health. For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.

A coworker and I both struggle with chronic anxiety, and I talked with her a lot right around the time I was starting to go to therapy. She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me.

I spoke frequently to a coworker who had a similar position to mine, and we often discussed the impact of this work on our state of mind.

Our company uses a chat program called Slack where there are many channels created to discuss various topics. I am part of the mental health channel. It is a safe space to talk about how we feel and what our struggles are. A lot of love and support is shared there. It is the best experience I've ever had regarding mental health discussions and the workplace. They talked about strategies they have when tough times occur and places at work to go if you need a break. They discussed their own diagnosis and medications. Having the ability to discuss with some co-workers about our mental health struggles means more to me than I can put into words.

I've seen both of these happen. I've talked to several people on my team about mental health. One of our conversations about where we went for therapy, but a lot of others have been about acknowledging the stress and anxiety in our lives and how we handle it(or don't). I mentioned that I had a lot of anxiety in my life during a 1 on 1, and my manager suggested that I start seeing a therapist. During the 1 on 1, she talked about how beneficial it was for her to have a therapist, and how it might help me. She forwarded me a link to a recommended office in my neighborhood after the meeting.

The coworkers I discussed this with were all very understanding. It was a huge mistake to ever mention my mental health with my supervisors. (This was as a graduate student in materials science.) I was immediately treated differently and with suspicion, subjected to unfair treatment intended to ‘help’ me that made matters much worse, was pressured into letting my supervisors contact my therapist and psychiatrist and ask questions about me, and then fired after my supervisors totally misinterpreted the answers they received. Even the HR department at the university was surprised by how badly they handled it. One of my coworkers has ongoing problems with anxiety and depression. It causes problems with her being able to come to work regularly and we have had several conversations trying to find ways to support her as well as let the team keep working together successfully. It’s a difficult situation with no obvious answers but we are all working together in good faith to get through it. After my experience at my previous job, there’s no way I would discuss my mental health issues with HR or management at a job unless it was completely unavoidable.

Some becoming overly problem-solvey. Others try to treat one overly gentle rather than normal with accomodation. See above. It's pretty generically the response. Of course I tend to downplay, say ""anxiety"" and not PTSD. Often it is depression or anxiety and I try to be understanding, supportive and/or share my own experiences. I'm not sure the scope of the project but people's feelings around medication for mental health disorders is interesting.

Most people in my previous company worked remotely, which has pros and cons for certain kinds of mental health issues.  We'd have somewhat open conversations about the fact that it was a unique issue for our company, but I don't think any tailored program was ever created.

I was fired after attempting suicide twice in 4 months. I had been relocated but my relocation pay was never deposited and I was sleeping in the back of a stranger's van and in hostels. The process for firing was supposed to be a 3 strikes kind of deal: chat with person above you, written notice you can reply to, firing action. Someone had a chat with me that was positive and talked about me levelling up. The next Monday after that, the head of HR and the head of the head of the whole department were on a surprise Skype call with me at 5 am their time to fire me, because I ""didn't appear happy"". When pressed by lawyers they said they didn't have to provide a reason. If they had done the written bit of their procedure, I could have submitted doctors' notes that I was going through stuff. But I wasn't going to just put that on the table when someone is having a ""casual chat"" about pathways and corrections and stuff, a first time chat. This is tough stuff. I was talking to someone who I thought was pretty open minded and that I thought we were close, but he physically recoiled for a second when I told him what I was struggling with.

Because the mental health is a lot more common on the tech industry it would be necessary for this industry, especially really big corps which are viewed as role examples, to push for a more significant change on that aspect. That was about 15 years ago, so take this info with some grand assault. Back in Brazil, 15 years ago, having depression was considered not to be a health issue but mainly a spoiled kid issue. So co-workers would treat bad who had it and who had it wouldn't say because of it. All of this changed now. Mental Health issue is treated with a lot respect in all levels back in Brazil. Had a major stress/depression breakdown and spoke to my supervisor about the treatment needed and the time that I was going to need to do the treatment. At the moment was that could either work or I could get fired but if I haven't had that talk I wouldn't know.

2018,"It seems to me, after 28-years in the IT field, that there is a much more open and honest dialogue about mental issues, perhaps due to the predilection of many with anxiety, mild functional autism, or Asperger's to gravitate to the field.

In other fields, these types of mental disorders are typically seen as weaknesses.  In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges. For classification purposes - I am a mid-40's male, with diagnosed anxiety and ADD.   I have done extensive research which leads me to strongly suspect that I am in the high-functioning end of the Asperger's spectrum.  Being high-functioning, I have progressed professionally into a management position for both technical and non-technical areas or responsibility.

Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial.

I have been told by HR to never disclose it with anyone. I have also been bullied by another boss and a manager at a small transportation company, Riolo Transportation (based in Carlsbad, CA) where they told me that since I had PTSD, they were unsure if they could trust me to do work. I don't see how either of those things correspond to each other, especially how I was a great worker and never caused any issues (if I made a mistake, I owned up to it and fixed it). I quit on the spot and they cussed me out. They became some of my closest friends after I disclosed to them that I suffer from PTSD. I discussed my mental health with my previous company (Applied Predictive Technologies) and they used it against me. Any time I needed to go home early due to sickness, HR would ask if it was physical or mental. When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!) I had no choice but to put in my two weeks shortly after I came back, to which they told me to pack up and leave. I was not respected at APT, and I would like for someone to look into this, if possible.

Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes. A coworker disclosed that they had ADHD when their cubicle was moved to a very busy and loud area of the office.  They had difficulty concentrating with the commotion around them and disclosed their ADHD (oh, totally forgot to mention this person when I talked about mental healthy convos with coworkers, anyway) to the employer and they rejected her request for an accommodation (a move to a quieter spot in the office) until they rephrased their request in formal, written terms that belied that they knew that the employer could be in violation of ADA by not accommodating them. After the accommodation was made, this person was labeled a trouble-maker by the executive staff and a careful, strategic effort was made to push this person out. Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews. They saw the writing on the wall and found employment elsewhere.  This person has recently received a lot of visibility for their success - they also now work remotely - so this is very much a success is the best revenge story. STILL. I've talked with my coworkers about my mental health on more than one occasion. I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment. Has to be the right person at the right time and sometimes I worry I overshare. But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding. I have openly discussed my struggles with anxiety and complex PTSD with my team, including my supervisor. I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work. I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...) I think I gave the tech sector 3 stars for dealing with mental illness, but I came to tech from the nonprofit sector and I would give them 1 star and that would be generous. Tech is fucking heaven compared to nonprofit work, where remote work is unheard of, benefits and wages are skimpy, and self-sacrifice is the name of the game. Some of my previous supervisors",,1

In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy. In discussing our workload, my coworker and I have talked about how we fit in to the current environment, and how stressful it feels to be left out of certain conversations, both in person and electronically.

There may have been other circumstances but I do not recall them at this time.

Depression has blunted my memory to the point where I don't remember simple things (I have any number of Stack Overflow bookmarks). The treatments are often as bad as the diseases. My antianxiety medication makes me fuzzy and apathetic. My friend who had ECT suffered *severe* memory loss and was unable to do her job for several weeks even after she was medically discharged. After I returned from my medical leave to attend PHP, I was shunned by pretty much every staff member at my site. No one would talk with me or even make eye contact with me. I needed support more than ever and my extended team isolated me, increasing the intensity of my symptoms. I had to tell my manager that my psychiatrist was putting me on a three-month leave for severe depression and anxiety, so I could attend a partial hospitalization program. He was neutrally supportive but clearly uncomfortable with the topic. After a large layoff in 2002, a group of four of us on the same team were affected with MH problems. At least two of us, including myself, have suffered with severe clinical depression ever since then. I have been to PHP and looked into getting experimental ketamine therapy; my friend/coworker became suicidal and underwent six weeks of ECT. At a previous job at a startup, I attempted to inform both my manager and the CEO about my MH problems. The CEO told me not to worry about it because ""we're all family"" and ""your health is the most important thing."" The manager just stared at me. Two days after my conversation with the CEO, I was ""laid off"" and lost all medical and MH benefits. I have been illegally fired from TWO tech jobs secondary to depression.

I frequently try to express my levels of stress or anxiety without being negative. Also, I'd like others to know if I'm not feeling well mentally so that we don't run into a situation where one of us is causing a problem to the other. Once I quit a job because of stress and relationship strain, having that conversation was pretty easy with the manager and not so easy with the CEO. Another company, during a divorce with my first wife, I became quite depressed and it was starting to impact my performance, attendance, etc. The manager of that company sat me down and asked how he could personally help. I think it may be good to speak to wellness in terms of addiction as well. I've known quite a few folks in the industry with addition issues—be them drugs, overworking or social media.

2018,"I think a lot of the tech industry pushes people towards burnout by encouraging people to be constantly working, both at work and outside of work. There's a general idea that making things at work isn't enough, that your job should also be your hobby outside of work. I think this is unhealthy and people should have different outlets and interests they're pursing in their free time. We don't expect people who do sales to be selling outside of work, why expect people who code for a living to also be coding outside of work? At previous employers, there was a general disregard for employee mental wellbeing via unreasonable deadlines and workloads, which  produced situations that encouraged burnout, frustration, stress, etc. This was especially hard on several co-workers who had existing mental health issues and worsened their symptoms. I've discussed having ADHD with several co-workers, most of them responded positively or were surprised. I discussed my ADHD with two other co-workers, one who was suffering from depression and another who also had ADHD. Some of my previous supervisors",,1

Alternately, make it possible to search for jobs that are sensitive/understanding around mental health concerns and don't raise anxiety as a standard management technique.

Often, I try to explain that the way daily checkin meetings are run is anxiety-provoking and decreases my productivity. Some are more understanding than others. My perception of the ""typical"" reaction is that they tell me I should go take a walk, or watch cute cat videos, or other armchair advice that really isn't sufficient for significant GAD/severe depression. That feels frustrating. I've had this discussion a ton of times. Most recently, we had a conversation where they told me I wasn't performing well enough and they were considering putting me on a PIP - after I'd told them I struggle with anxiety. Prior to that, I'd had a conversation with my manager where he was applying heavy pressure for a deadline and I tried to explain that high pressure escalates my anxiety makes me freeze and become less productive.

There has been covert and open discrimination against employees with personality disorders and mental health issues everywhere I have worked, because there very little is done to pursue civil compensation for workers who are targets of mental health-based discrimination.

State explicit support for employees who are dealing with mental health issues and say that they are just as important as physical health issues. Offer health insurance plans that subsidize or cover mental health. Be more aware of addiction/alcoholism recovery and be more sensitive/sensible with work events. One manager at a previous job opened up to me about being in recovery from alcoholism/addiction, and so I opened up to them about it. Unfortunately, this first manager moved into another department and I got a new manager. I decided to be open with the new manager both about my recovery status and having major depression. At first they were supportive. Then, when I decided to quit, they said a lot of extremely hurtful things including calling me lazy, saying that I wanted people to hold my hand, and many condescending comments such as ""Are you sure you should really quit your job right now with your 'condition'?"" all which essentially resulted in gaslighting, since they tried to refute every reason I listed for quitting by saying it was all my fault. I became close enough to consider some of my past coworkers friends. I was able to open up to them about medications I was taking, seeing a therapist, and the struggles I was going through. These friends were very supportive, some ended up asking for advice about getting their own therapy. It was really a relief to have people I could trust and be honest with at work, if I was feeling extra bad on some days. Once i chose to confide in a manager about my battle with major depression and recovery from addiction/alcoholism. They later threw it in my face when I decided to quit and used my past honesty to insult me. In germany at least, compared to the USA, doctors notes are extremely respected and must be accepted for days off. The employer never knows the reason for the doctor's note and they can't force employees to work. I used to live in the USA and always had a hard time getting sick days at all, and worrying about the reason was a major source of stress.

I've submitted my notice at this role, and found that there are no mental health policies put into place, nor coverage.

When speaking to them about my depression, they seemed to be understanding and empathetic to my situation. At a previous company, I had a co-worker who was a bully to me and who would berate me and undermine me in all of our meetings. I had brought this up both to the co-worker and to my manager, but my manager dismissed it because my co-worker was a woman. I brought the issue up to HR and they told me that the company will pay for up to 3 sessions with a counselor if I felt I needed it.

When I discussed my anxiety and burnout the situation was left unchanged for so long that things just got worse to the point I had to quit I talked with nearly every team member who asked about my back pain, some of them I told about the burnout and that it was all work related. I didn’t go into much more detail than that but people either seemed surprised for the reason I was leaving the company or they seemed to understand because they felt the same. Discussed burnout which is a combination of mostly anxiety and physical symptoms like severe back pain and increased heart rate and trouble sleeping. The stress was all related to incompetent management and political games that prevented me from moving to a better team within the organization. When I discussed issues with managers and requested moving to another team, they refused. After numerous conversations with HR I finally got a new manager but this did not resolve other incompetencies with management and the business strategy. I was told I could ask a dr for a note to use my sick time to recover. I was not given the option to take medical leave or short term disability for the back pain that was so severe I couldn’t stand up straight one day, and had to go home early several times. Eventually the back pain got bad enough I decided to quit the job and be unemployed rather than continue to suffer. I talked about dealing with depression from loss of a pet as well as an emotionally abusive relationship and then Trump being elected. I discussed depression related to an emotionally abusive relationship. They allowed me to leave work early to make it to therapy sessions. There seems to be an epidemic of narcissistic personality disorder, not sure if that’s a Bay Area or a tech industry or a startup culture thing.

I feel that some companies completely ignore it from a historical lack of admitting emotions in the work environment and others allow employees to take time off, work from home, have less structured days/offices to help.

A manager failed to apprise an employee of the availability of medical leave when the employee  was experiencing an extended depressive episode resulting from medication changes. This, combined with the manager switching him from project to project rapidly and not being able to demonstrate execution of work tasks effectively, resulted in that manager firing the employee because of underperformance and erratic behavior instead of a more proper approach: take some time off. We talked about burnout because I took a Friday afternoon off after working ~44 hours during the first four days of the week. They agreed that I'd done enough work for the week. We talked about burnout a lot as well as unhappiness and hopelessness in relationships. One employee had recently relocated and the move was very stressful because of leaving a childhood home city and realizing she was not going to see some friends again ever. The greatest point of stress in managing people with mental health issues is managing up. How can I tell my boss that someone needs to take a week off because they dealt with self-harmful thoughts all weekend? I like to think that I'm a pretty woke boss but I don't know if my boss and their boss are as accommodating, understanding, and empathetic to the individual in the face of ""if we don't ship this feature we will literally go bankrupt"".

Ultimately, anyone who's not pulling their weight is a liability. If someone's health, physical or mental, is impacting the business's ability to survive, when should the business sever the relationship?

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources. Lead by example. Mentally healthy supervisors help foster mentally healthy employees. We spoke about depression and how it can impact our work. We both dealt with this from time to time and it was overall a positive experience.

She stayed in that abusive relationship for stability. Our management knew about this. He ended up beating her to death in their own house. He recently got convicted of her murder after three years of trial and prosecution.

I told my direct manager that I had suffered from PPD and had a history of depression when I was younger. I also told her that I had a history of substance abuse and sought treatment twice for my condition. Both times in high school. Mental health is considered taboo in many Asian cultures. Growing up, I was told that depression was a myth that white Americans make up as an excuse to be lazy or weak. ""Talking about feelings"" was reserved for weak women.

I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it. I've only had surface level conversations, more so feeling out their situation and understanding of mental health and mental health issues. Discussed Anxiaty disorder and how my previous job negatively effected it and my overall health/happyness. My employer was understanding of the situation. I did not request any action to be taken nor did they offer. We agreed to just be upfront and honest in our communication.

Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills. My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee. The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently. When I was diagnosed with ADHD and began treatment, I discussed it with my boss and supervisor. At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed. We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it. I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial. I like to think that I've helped my superiors become more willing to accept my differences (and hopefully others'), and find the unique values that an ADHD brain can bring.

I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.

One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor. Thank you, I really needed this survey. Love you all ❤️ No, none of my previous supervisors",,1

Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness. They were my coworkers but they are my friends, so the talks were very productive and they were/are supportive. As simple as it could be I was direct and, at that moment I was ok, if I was fired, and said that I needed therapy and probably treatment for my stress level. He was ok with (as even if it wasn't ok, he didn't have an option) and from the therapist, I was directed to a doctor and got treated. A solid great decision that helped me extremely.

Typically, I've discussed mental health with other coworkers also struggling with issues. This mostly served to feel a sense of not being alone in these challenges. I've discussed issues with depression, and anxiety, that have directly impacted my performance. They were understood and all was ok. I've had numerous coworkers tell me that they were not doing well either related to work stress or independent of work. In some cases, they were already seeking help and needed to vent or share. In other cases, if they were interested in feedback, I recommended talking to a therapist in addition to friends. Working in a digital field means always being connected.

It was about depression and feeling unable to do anything. The reaction was a suggestion to start with little things. I don’t think the IT industry is particularly worse than others in how people react to mental health problems; but I think the job itself carries a higher risk of developing such issues, because of its nature. Staring at a screen alone, antisocial working hours, continuous stress to learn and adapt to new stuff... it’s a bad mix.

2019,"Take it as seriously as physical health support. Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder. The context was a meeting between several coworkers, including one who was suffering greatly from anxiety, which was impeding her work. I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me. It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship. As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself.

She had to hand in her laptop before her leave and give her password to the bullying manager. It was appalling, and was supported by HR and the executives. As a person who had previously revealed mental health problems (and had stood up for my co-worker), I knew I could no longer stay at the company and resigned shortly after. At my old job I told a few people, including one manager I had during my time there. They were generally supportive but it was hard for them to understand unless they had direct experience with mental illness themselves or through someone close to them. Mostly supportive. People either reveal their own mental health struggles (surprisingly common) or try to understand. Sometimes I end up feeling worse if I can tell they are struggling themselves but act like they've got it all together and seem determined not to show weakness. I've also occasionally had people become very uncomfortable and then withdraw from the relationship. I've had to take time off for mental health (usually about 4 weeks) a few times in my career.

It was ignored for several months until I was at a point where I was largely unable to perform my work duties.

I approached a former boss (who still worked at the company) in April who gave me advice on ways to delegate my work and allow myself some time to recover. My current manager felt like I had gone behind their back when in fact I had approached them first. 

In July, things reached a breaking point and I approached my previous manager for advice on how to ask for significant time off for medical reasons. They went with me to my current manager and I received 2.5 weeks off with the promise of more if I needed it.

However, when the director met with me for an evaluation, he addressed some concerns around breaks I was taking.  It was at this point I shared with him the conversations I had with the other two staff members and how I was addressing these gaps with their support.  His response was ""well while I appreciate the whole depression thing, you have to do your job"" and from that point forward, I found him treating me differently, for example, scheduling a meeting for a day when I was taking PTO where he shared information that directly impacted my team. I made decisions about which coworkers to discuss mental health with, but I have had conversations over lunch (off-site) about periodic anxiety, as well as conversations with some of my team mates about my misophonia as it has impacts on my focus and concentration in meetings so I like to make people aware of it so I can ask for accommodations when needed.

All this happened AFTER the company I worked for had their annual ""year start"" gathering in SFO. When it became apparent that I have anxiety, and it was interfering with my ability to complete tasks, my boss put me on a PIP that was impossible to achieve. I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with. Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep? My supervisor was dumbfounded the first time he observed me during a (job-related) anxiety attack when I completely forgot how to do something simple and routine. He spent two hours asking me leading questions to help me solve my problem instead of gently reminding me. I thought I was going to cry. He said ""what can I do to help you"", made a few suggestions, faked empathy. And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully. Discussing imposter syndrome, feeling like you can't take a break, nothing gets done fast enough.
The response from my coworker was a lot of ""oh yea, me too"" Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it. I had no idea at the time that this is anxiety. I'm sure my boss knew. my coworker/good friend was describing how sad she was feeling after several traumatic events in rapid succession and bad turn of events at work.

The goal of these conversations is always to make it feel as normal as a discussion about accommodations for a broken leg. No, none of my previous supervisors",,1
2019,"Take an active interest in the person and tailor the approach to the needs of the individual. One size fits all offerings of gym membership and health insurance is nothing more than a HR box ticking exercise. Providing access to counseling services would probably be more beneficial. In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation. In addition to making the affected individual happier about themselves, they would be more productive in an environment where they felt they as an individual were cared about. A colleague who had just volunteered the fact that they almost ended their life on the way to work was basically told ""Well you're here now so you might as well get on with the job."" I told them that felt like I was an impostor, that I was stealing a living because I was unable to concentrate and focus on my job. Thoughts and concerns about my family were constantly distracting me. They were supportive and revealed that they themselves were dealing with depression and had been for years, the medication they were taking dulled the anxiety but also their ability to concentrate and focus so it took them longer to complete tasks. It made me feel better that I wasn't alone in what I was experiencing but also more determined to not look to medication for a solution. Keep up the good work! Some of my previous supervisors",,1

The stress at times became unbearable. Though through the years it has become easier and more acceptable at least somewhat. It appeared that they were not very well informed about the issues and yet there was some understanding. I chose to reveal the extent of my problems slowly. I also only spoke about these to my direct superior leaving other coworkers somewhat in the dark and not discussing about my disorder and any mental aspects with them.

Since there was no option in the survey to be on benefit support I chose to write about my last employment. Already mentioned.

I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis. My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation. This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally. I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness.

Beating employees over the head (metaphorically) with resources they can use and continuing to broadcast success stories from either brave self-identifying folks or anonymous folks de-mystifies the problem and may motivate others to see that there is support and ""a way forward"" rather than suffering and potentially unhealthy coping reinforced by a culture of ""dealing with it yourself"".",,1

My manager was curious but clearly not informed, and HR was very political. Ultimately, talking to my employer about my mental health led to no positive change and only increased anxiety. I bring up my mental health without being very specific as a way to inform coworkers about my tendencies in a team environment. I speak often, I pitch ideas, and I appreciate being called out when I go overboard. They are usually very thankful and responsive if I work with them on a daily basis, but coworkers that are not part of my team tend to not respond as well. I'm usually able to sense if someone is going through some sort of mental health related difficulty and I let them know that I'm there to listen or talk. They often open up about what is going on, specially if I share my own hardships first. Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers Same as my previous answer. I would bring up physical health issues if they meant that I would require special accommodations or potential time off. I would bring up my mental health with a potential employer in order to analyze their response and get an idea of what the culture around mental health is. Also, I like to focus on my strengths and neurodiversity. I was promoted from engineer to engineering manager and the role was not well defined. I asked for help and feedback because I didn't know whether I was being effective or not and did not receive any help. This made my job very difficult, and went from being the #1 evaluated employee in the department as an engineer, to a very poor evaluation a year later. I am no longer an engineering manager and was demoted. Everyone is unique, and many of us have slightly different brains. The industry could benefit greatly from tapping into the strengths of this diversity and creating safe, productive environments. Hiring people in tech is hard and there is a lot of competition, we need to take care of employees so that churn goes down and mental health support can go a long way. Thank you",,1

He is also a friend outside of work so I felt comfortable telling him that I sometimes have a few days or even a week where it can be difficult to get through the day due to depression and anxiety.

He said to let him know if there is ever anything he can do to help, whether that means scheduling regular mental health days, taking longer or more frequent breaks, or even just talking. He also made it clear that there would be no questions asked nor judgement passed were I to do any of those things.

It was the first time I had ever discussed my mental health with an employer. Yes, he is also a friend, but in that moment he was my manager and he was doing an amazing job. I have become increasingly emboldened to discuss my mental health due to the positive and supportive culture in my company. It is difficult.

I used to make regular excuses for not attending social events or for bailing on plans, but at some point I decided to disclose to a couple of close work friends that usually I am just feeling depressed and need to recharge.

They responded with genuine concern and understanding without bombarding me with questions. They really helped normalize the whole experience.

I've observed coworkers making negative comments about another coworker due to his sometimes erratic mood, which I know to be due to his mental health issues. Explicitly state that mental health issues present as valid a reason for taking a sick day as physical health issues.

The covid crisis brought us millions of people with mental issues that will not be treated as required.  However, the increase of workers that could also work from home in asynchronous ways creates space for solutions that could compensate.

People unwilling to understand a need for compromising day-to-day procedure to accommodate mental health needs. The industry and employers tend to push towards overwork and stress which trigger and exacerbate existing conditions. I think clear understandings of time off and providing employees time to deal with their mental health issues is a huge first step. Secondly, I think this needs to be active support and encouragement for folks to get used to taking advantage of it and understanding it is OK to say ""no"" to additional work and responsibilities that will cause mental health challenges.

And they did, they helped me and my family with financial issues, helped me finding a psychiatrist and even sent colleagues to drive me to a doctor when I wasn't allowed to drive the car by myself. 
After getting better, I had a warm welcome in my company. Now, one year later, they still occassionally ask like ""Are you fine?"", ""Please mind your health"", ...

He did offer information about resources and all that but I already know about and use those. 1. I told my coworker I was dealing with situational depression because I didn’t want him to think I’m lazy or not passionate about what we do. He was supportive, he’s really nice. He mentioned he understands and doesn’t think it should be taboo either and later we became friends. My other coworker who I told recently was really nice and understanding and great. But there are a lot of people in the office that I wouldn’t want to discuss it with. There are a couple people at our company that I’m actually friends with. They’re all women and/or gay which is kind of telling and not surprising. We have all discussed mental health briefly, some in depth. One of them has discussed their depression and medication and all that with me. Another has mentioned their mental health mostly in relation to being a transgender person.

Most employers would view that negatively / would be less likely to hire me I think. I don’t want to be seen as someone who is weak or making excuses. This needs to change. Seriously, we need to give people sick AND mental health paid time off SEPARATE from vacation pto. We should not have to choose between vacation and mental health days.

2020,"I was having some issues in the team I was working in, firstly with my appointed coach, and later with the lead-link of the circle I was part of. Unfortunately the counselling itself didn't work, and I chose to join a different circle, where I am myself in a position to help others with some of the issues I had. At the beginning of the pandemic we were all working from home, and I started to feel less motivated, and I felt a bit sombre.
I was able to mention this in the stand-up we do every morning, and at that moment I got some help from our coach, but also we started to have the coffee and Friday afternoon chats on our meeting platform. The co-worker in question had some anxiety issues with the team the person was in. That was the moment that person was able to talk with me. 

We talked about the issues the person was having, and later the person thanked me for listening, and decided to take a position in a team that was not toxic. No, none of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers My previous employer was a bit of a special case, it was a small e-commerce company with about 15 people working in it.

At some point the company itself was having a very toxic atmosphere created by some of the co-workers working with me.

I started discussing the issues I had with a co-worker and we were both relieved that we shared some of the issues that we saw. Unfortunately we couldn't change much of the company, so we decided both on different times that we had to leave the company itself. If it is a part of me, then I would want to share that during the interview.

If I wouldn't it could also be perceived as not being honest with the employer. Actually it was part of the last interview I did with my current employer, we even did a test on what my personal profile was at that moment in time.

And the country where I live does value honesty about anything, so if I would have had a mental illness the employer would like to know so upfront and don't get to know it later. We had a co-worker at my previous workplace that has Asperger, so the person had to sit alone to not have to many impulses from outside.

However this person was always spoken of as if the person was different and wouldn't be able to deliver. The first thing is to make any person on what level in the company feeling safe to open up about the issues the person is facing.

In the teams I've been working at our current company we do try to make the team as safe as possible so that anybody will be able to open up and discuss the issues they're facing.",,1

A coworker told me they were very depressed, and I listened and recommended some mental health resources to them for additional support. Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers Same as before. I would be very hesitant to bring up a physical health issue in an interview. I usually wait until I have already won a company over on hiring me until I mention my physical health issues. I wouldn't bring up a mental health issue as I believe it would prohibit me from being employed. I believe that the entire mental health issue needs to be seriously addressed in this country to be more accepting and less stigmatizing.

2021,"I have regularly scheduled meetings with my manager weekly. If I feel that my performance has suffered because of my mental health, I try and mention that during those meetings. He listens and has shared his own experiences with anxiety and productivity concerns, and usually asks if there are any resources I'm lacking, or if the organization can support me more in any way. Because we have open discussions within the org, generally annually as a part of Mental health awareness month, or in times of stress like the onset of lockdown, I felt like open communication was a better option than leaving it unsaid. It also really helped that the first response from my manager when I brought up these concerns was empathy / sharing his own personal experiences with me, so we've built a very trusting relationship. I have a few confidants that I regularly speak to about anxiety. One of them started at the same time as me, so we have daily meeting on the calendar that we sometimes use if one of us needs some emotional support. We use it to lament about our knowledge gaps, pair program, chat about our personal lives, or help each other figure out how to talk about how we're feeling to our managers / co-workers. We also use it to validate each other into taking mental wellness days when we're anxious about taking too many because it's not a ""real sick day"" or we took ""too many already recently"". A common conversation I've had is ""I feel like such shit today, but I took two sick days last week and I just feel like it's too many."" To which the response is usually ""mental health should be a priority, and you should rest if you need to"". We also talk about imposter syndrome a lot and how we constantly feel like we don't know what we're doing and how we feel like everyone is smarter than us. But how that's also clearly wrong, and we're just mentally ill. I'm lucky to have someone that shares so many feelings with me. Some of my previous supervisors I didn't feel comfortable going into details, as I didn't want it to turn into a therapy session. So I generally kept it vague enough to seem like it could be physical illness: ""I don't feel well, I think I'll go home"" Yes, at all of my previous employers I would only talk about it within my friend circle, which included a friend from college who I already knew suffered from mental issues. We both talked about our depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. I have chronic back pain, which is a physical issue, but it rarely comes up when discussing whether or not I'd make a good potential employee. If anything, I'd just disclose that info to get certain resources like a standing desk. Otherwise, it's just rarely relevant to my day to day. Mental health affects my experience much more than my physical conditions. It feels like it would affect my hire-ability to know that there are regularly occurring days where I can't perform any engineering tasks because I'm overwhelmed / anxious / depressed. I would also worry that they wouldn't believe me, or think I was lazy, or question my work ethic, etc. Education and discussion. Managerial policies for handling direct reports with mental health issues. Mental wellness days as a separate category of sick days. Having done a few other jobs outside of the tech industry, mostly in the tutoring/physical activity instructor sphere, Engineering seems particularly challenging for those suffering from a mental illness. The irregularity can be disorienting as some days you're able to do your job just fine, and others you can feel completely paralyzed and anxious that if anyone found out, you'd be outed as a bad engineer.

On my current team, a few of us have mental illnesses. We openly talk about therapy, share when we have bad days as well as victories.

Yes, at all of my previous employers Since mental health in tech became such an important topic to me, I've made myself available as a resource for others to discuss this with. Sometimes, people just want someone to listen. Sometimes, they want advice or support. I do my best to provide that. It would depend on the situation and whether the physical health issue is relevant to the position. Again, it would depend on whether it impacted my job and seemed appropriate to bring up at the time. I've interviewed with a few people who have seen my mental health talks, so the topic sometimes comes up naturally in interviews.

Stop thinking of tech workers like robots or worker ants. And stop expecting software devs to somehow spend all their personal time working on projects or training on something the employer needs. I honestly believe that the lack of empathy in the tech world, specifically Software Dev, is the major driver of mental health issues in our industry. In my experience, managers treat devs as robots that can work extra hours, learn any new tech and deliver high quality projects all at the same time.

I do not want to bring this up but if I do not then people are surprised when the symptoms come up. So I have to bring it up even if I do not want to, and then I do not get jobs because I am a risky employee. Not expect people to work 90 hour weeks? Not extolling the virtues of ""fast paced environments""? Not putting the expectation that every applicant is a 10x rockstar? But of course companies want the best of the best, not me.

2021,"I talked about being overwhelmed and unable to handle even the slightest noises or stimuli due to complete burnout. My supervisor appeared to be understanding but from my perspective it felt like she kept turning it back to me to determine the solution and I had no idea what to do. A week or so later I told her I had to quit due to having no more care to give. At that point she seemed to realize how seriously I meant it and we brainstormed solutions including allowing me to take 2 weeks of PTO. She also encouraged me to come up with creative solutions and boundaries to prioritize my stability. I've had several coworkers tell me about codependency and addiction struggles. I usually try to listen, empathize, and validate but sometimes I think that results in me reinforcing learned helplessness or victim mentality. It's tough to find that balance of encouraging acceptance and also empowerment. Which I guess is the whole point of the serenity prayer. Also, I realize that I probably haven't fully answered your question but my focus struggles... due to mental health :) Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers There's a lot of variables. Would it affect my work? Is it chronic or temporary? How minimal is it? What caused it? In 2017, I couldn't use my right arm due to shooting myself in the chest a few months prior to a job interview. During the interview I believe I said that I was in physical therapy for a nerve injury  but would have full function in the next 6 months. I think that matters quite a bit as well... whether you can offer a prognosis or an estimate of what the future looks like and recovery. This one leans way further towards ""not likely"" but I suppose given the right circumstance I would mention it. Maybe in an example of resilience or facing tough challenges but the reference would most likely be minimized and offered in the light of solutions and new-found manageability. Preventative care and normalizing struggle. I think as a society we have this aversion to being uncomfortable and we pathologize natural human experience. In tech, there's this constant drive for ""bigger, stronger, faster"" which now is becoming increasingly offset with these crash vacations of nothingness. There's no balance. Not to mention the isolation and lack of routine and connection that so many in tech deal with. Intense pressure on deliverables. So many these days, including me, have horrible executive functioning skills and try to white-knuckle grip performance. Also, I believe the amount of substance use, especially stimulants is completely under-reported. You guys are doing important, powerful work and I hope your mission gets more attention, funding, and resources to make real change happen. Sadly, I believe the macro systems will take something bigger than a pandemic to shake our predictable comfort zone. Oh, I do think questions about freelancing and working independently would be an interesting study. The isolation, pressure, and necessity for self-accountability and discipline are something that so many people think they can handle and then they crash and burn and are ashamed. Some personality types are just not a good fit for solo work. I may be the best baker in the world with dreams of wanderlust and independence... who absolutely runs my bakery into the ground. My mean banana bread can't compensate for poor management skills, horrible bookkeeping, and overexpansion with that Bird Bakery food truck... we make baked goods for birds but for some reason, people keep getting the wrong idea.

I also believe previous employers may also handle this well as mental health has come to the forefront in recent years and I see a push to be more caring in these matters across the industry, though there is still a long way to go.",,1
2021,"It might help them understand any difficulties related to my health that I face during work that might affect my performance. Managing mental health issues requires a lot of effort from the person affected. I am worried that an ongoing mental health issue might be perceived as an indication that I am not responsible enough to put in the work required.

I am also worried that the uncertain, sporadic nature of mood disorders might make the interviewer consider me as potentially non-reliable.

Also, mental health issues are commonly perceived in my social circle as ""millennials making excuses for their laziness""; I am worried I would be viewed as making excuses. This is what I wish I had at my first job - 

1. As part of employee orientation, include sessions on mental health and wellness
2. Stress the importance of taking breaks 
3. Make blog posts on organizational intranet about how it is okay to go through difficult times
4. Provide/ link to resources to manage mental health
5. Have monthly non-work related events for socialization with colleagues, even something as simple as stepping out for coffee as a team. We appreciate the passionate people who dedicate their entire lives to their work but it is important to let people know that it is not required for every single employee to be like that. Good performance at work during the work within reasonable work timings should be enough to qualify as a great employee.",,1

2021,"My boss was pretty ambivalent. Seemed uncomfortable and unsure how to react. Nervously started talking about experiences she had that were not at all like what I was describing to her. I think she was *trying* to relate, when what I really needed was to feel heard. No actions were taken and honestly left the conversation feeling drained and a little dismissed. I've had conversations with members of our Neurodiversity/mental health group that have gone really well. I never really shake the feeling that I am oversharing though. For my other coworkers, I bring it up and feel heard/seen or validated in varying degrees but again, most of the time it feels like I've taken my clothes off. I have a few coworkers that I can be vulnerable with but mostly I'm left feeling cold. Because of my affiliation with the ERG I mentioned previously, I've had people reach out to me on several occassions to talk about their own mental health - in varying degrees of crisis. I do my best, but I often don't feel equipped. My goals this year are to complete training such as Mental Health First Aid so that I don't do more harm than good in these situations. No, none of my previous supervisors Only one boss. He gave helpful advice and later became my mentor.

No, at none of my previous employers I would be concerned that it would affect my ability to get the position because they would think I am somehow less capable than other applicants. Same answer. I don't want to be seen as less capable. They might make up a story based on what they have seen mental illness portrayed as in the media that I will cause problems, behave problematically, take a lot of management, or otherwise be a risky hire. We need to change people's minds about what the capabilities of people with mental illness are. Just because you have mental illness, does not mean ytou are resigned to a life that is sad, disconnected, difficult, or unprosperous. People need to understand that talking about these perceptions are the only way to change them. Love that you are doing this work, I've just heard about it through the ERG I mentioned. I am going to mention to leadership that we find ways to amplify what you are doing as we are also an open source company and I would love to see how we can support you.",,1

2021,"I had an episode and went to the hospital. It was a panic attack. My direct manager took me there and stayed until I got accepted. I'm bipolar 2 and after this episode I started to be more open about my illness. It may be just an impression, but my coworkers started to be really careful about me and anytime they asked me about it it was ""how are you?"", ""are you feeling better?"", they were never capable of using the word bipolar, for example, as if it was a taboo of some sort. Some of my previous supervisors I was working too much and started to perform worse that it was supposed to be, given the amount of time I was putting. I was not aware at that point, but I was probably about to have a burnout. We went to this meeting, just three of us, to discuss technical related topics. At some point, my performance became a topic and I ended up crying. My coworker and manager were really understanding and made me feel comfortable, even though I was really afraid of crying in the workplace.  Till this day, I have a really good friendship with this coworker. By the way, this experience happened in another country (from the previous question). The previous one happened in Germany and this one in Brazil At some of my previous employers It was the outcome of some episode. I had to be open and tell them what was happening. After that, they became more understanding, but sometimes in a bad way, like if I was not capable to handle pressure as I would be before they knew about the illness. Of course, if we are talking about a physical health issue which is going to affect my work, I would bring, but if we are talking about, let's say, diabetes (and I have it under control) I cannot see any reasons for bring it to discussion in an interview. I cannot see the point of bringing it during the interview process. Just like the physical illness, I could bring it if it was something that could impact my performance. It seems to me that bad management makes a huge impact on people's mental health. It is where all the unnecessary pressure starts, the unnecessary short deadlines, the frequent change of priority. I think having the industry pacing down, respecting the processes, and giving people reasonable deadlines, would make a great difference. Other than that, a more humane HR, open channels for discussing mental health and more flexible vacation/sick days would represent a good change. It is normal having people from one country, living in another one answering this survey (I think). When asked about experiences, for instance, it would be nice, and probably interesting for the research, having the answers attached to the country where it happened. The experience I had in Brazil is completely different from the experience I'm having now living in Germany.",,1

Physical health I was aware of some Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers No, I thought this survey was interesting, and actually made me reflect on my own views and made me realize that I am less comfortable discussing mental health issues than I thought, I might workplace is less comfortable discussing mental health issues and I thought. I think a survey similar to this could have the impact, beyond gathering information, of helping companies and individuals perform that self-reflection about their views on mental health. That self reflection is a starting point for change. I would only bring up if I need some sort of accomodations",,1
2023,"i was fired from my last full-time role at Booz Allen for my mental illness. they blackballed me, had it marked as “poor performance” though there were no indicators i was in any way insufficient, then fought my claims for unemployment benefits. i never was able to get unemployment. some supportive, some went behind my back and used information to file slanderous complaints with clients or hr. i was charged with doing and saying things i didn’t do or say. i learned that nobody could be trusted, and identity politics and advocacy doesn’t include people like me i had an employee who abused trust and support and avoided doing their job for two years. their managers were afraid to manage them for fear of being charged with discrimination see previous responses. i would have sued if I could have found an attorney willing to work in spec or pro bono. losing my job made it impossible to be able to hire an attorney there is a lot of rhetoric around mental health, and de&i in general, but everyone (i sadly haven’t yet seen an actual exception to this) does it wrong. Same level of comfort for each No, I only became aware later Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers i’d like to see a scorecard or metric that rates orgs on this subject… using real data. “top rated places to work” are always bullshit, and companies and their HR depts are very good at protecting their public images. I am pursuing a start up because I am left feeling unhirable and unable to trust bureaucracies i don’t have a hand in creating, 25 years into my career it depends if it may be applicable or if i consider it need to know",,0
2023,"Explained I was struggling with anxiety and depression. He thanked me for telling him. That was about it. The co-worker I work with the most and I talk about mental health all the time and are very supportive of one another. But we are also good friends outside of work. Same as previous. My closest coworker talks to me on a regular basis about their mental health Explained that I was struggling with anxiety. The supervisor suggested I reach out to our employee assistance program for more help. On a regular basis talking about what’s going on in our lives and the mental health issues that affect us ie, anxiety and depression Same as previous answers Being open and upfront about mental health all the time as opposed to only when there’s a serious issue. Same level of comfort for each I was aware of some Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers Na Depending on what the job is and how the physical issue may affect my work, I wouldn’t feel comfortable until I knew more about the employer’s attitude",,1
2023,"They actually brought the subject up based on how I responded to situations at work.  They were very supportive and when I made the decision to terminate my employment (I was missing a fair amount of work because of my condition), we parted on very good terms. Just that I was struggling and wanted them to pray for me, to which they assured me they would and continued to be very supportive. There is alot of media ""noise"" about it and, in general, it has been my experience that people in the industry are very supportive. Same level of comfort for each N/A (was not aware) Yes, all of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers If they are interested in hiring me, I want them to know so they can make the best decision based on me and my struggles, whether mental, physical or otherwise.",,1
2023,"I discussed the anxiety and depression as symptoms of my adhd. They were understanding and helped make some adjustments and accommodations. A coworker and I discussed our similar mental health issues and diagnoses. It was mural beneficial. I’ve had coworkers mention their anxiety and ask for advise about managing that with their work. I mentioned my anxiety and adhd and that I wanted to make some changes to help me. She basically said it was my problem to figure out on my own. Some of us shared anecdotes about our various mental health disorders and issues. Sharing anecdotes and supporting each other I was told my issues were my own to deal with and no accommodations would be made to help me. This was specifically related to my ADHD. Discuss it openly. Allow people to work more autonomously in a way that works for them. Physical health No, I only became aware later Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers It’s generally irrelevant to my work and not work mentioning.",,1
