His wife also had OCD, which often proved a great annoyance to him, so I usually did not talk about my own mental health. I joked that I was the best candidate for the job because I have crippling OCD and that makes me a good programmer. I was then hired. So, my previous employer was a factory. I was an in-house web programmer; I was 1099 so that my employer wouldn't have to pay for my health insurance or overtime. Before that I worked in call centers doing tech support. I have also worked as a server, a pizza maker, and a stripper. We need to remember that as much as it sucks to have mental illness within the tech industry, we're actually really privileged to work for employers that typically pay us living wages and provide us health insurance. Up until I became a programmer, most of my employers & supervisors would've just told me to kick rocks and grow up if I had mentioned my mental health troubles. Things could be a lot worse. While we must pull ourselves up, we must also look out for those who support our industry as well: the caregivers, the cooks, the tradesworkers, etc. Without these sorts of workers, who usually get meaningfully worse mental health treatment than we do, our industry would not exist.

Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out. I was at one time berated to the point of experiencing a dissociative episode while sitting in my supervisor's office with a coworker present. When I later confronted the coworker about this, they did not apologize. Also, due to symptoms earlier in the year, I experienced a lapse in performance for one week (the consequences of which were minor). As a result of this I am currently being singled out and micromanaged and my behavior in the office policed, in addition to (at least the perception of) being gaslit by my current supervisor, who ""could not"" supply concrete evidence of my lack of performance. I've unofficially disclosed diagnoses to coworkers. They haven't said anything about them to me since. One coworker in particular has been told about 3 or 4 times about a particular diagnosis and seems to have selective memory about it. ""I am not your therapist."" (This happens any time I mention any symptom. I do my best not to, but at times it is impossible.) The coworker was very supportive and did their best to help me. My supervisor was outwardly understanding at first but the situation eventually became discriminatory in nature A coworker has told me over drinks that she worked out a plan with our direct supervisor for how to manage some of her symptoms.

Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all.

She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me.

I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with new responsibilities, and they directed me to OSMI. They also advised me to talk to my HR team directly, as they had partnered with Cognitive Behavioral Therapists and I could have taken sessions if I found it to get worse.

2017,"Stop advocating late-hour work and meeting impossible deadlines as the cool thing to do. Openly admit to feelings of anxiety or frustration or depression, especially from people in leading roles. Look for ways to maximise ""effective work"" rather than ""8 hours a day"". Allow (and applaud) taking a break if things are not working. Allow (and applaud) taking care of not work-related issues if they are worrying.

I'd add depression to the list above. Some of my previous supervisors",1

2017,"First, acknowledge it exists. Second, educate people so they understand that a person is not a disorder. Those first two steps alone could take a really long time. I was fired after attempting suicide twice in 4 months. I had been relocated but my relocation pay was never deposited and I was sleeping in the back of a stranger's van and in hostels. The process for firing was supposed to be a 3 strikes kind of deal: chat with person above you, written notice you can reply to, firing action. Someone had a chat with me that was positive and talked about me levelling up. The next Monday after that, the head of HR and the head of the head of the whole department were on a surprise Skype call with me at 5 am their time to fire me, because I ""didn't appear happy"". When pressed by lawyers they said they didn't have to provide a reason. If they had done the written bit of their procedure, I could have submitted doctors' notes that I was going through stuff. But I wasn't going to just put that on the table when someone is having a ""casual chat"" about pathways and corrections and stuff, a first time chat. This is tough stuff. I was talking to someone who I thought was pretty open minded and that I thought we were close, but he physically recoiled for a second when I told him what I was struggling with. It's all such a huge pile of spaghetti and experiences over years in my head. I wouldn't know where to start or what to tell you. No, none of my previous supervisors",0

It's very hard to make genuine connections when you are marginalized, which means any mental health problems you have are born by yourself alone.

I notified them that, despite being medicated and mostly stable, he should expect me to call in sick and/or take leave because of my mental illness between 2 and 4 times a year, based on previos years. They stated that was not a problem and that, if need be, I could ask for time of short-term, rather than needing to adhere to their two week policy. They thanked me for my frankness and stated I could talk/arrange things with the company apointed confidential counselor rather than my manager if that made me feel more comfortable. I thanked them but declined, stating I prefer being open about my mental health issues and keeping both my teammates and maner in the loop. I informed them I have Bipolar Disorder and explained to them what that means, how it affects me, how it might effect my work and what they can expect from me if things go poorly. They expressed gratitude for my frankness and offered support and encouragement.

For some people, telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. 

They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However, western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias, seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.",2

I told my team that I had been experiencing higher than usual anxiety one week. I told my supervisor that my anxiety was making it difficult for me to do my work.

2019,"I have no idea. It was over 15 years ago, I cannot remember and feel that has been a good thing not to. At times there was understanding, at others it took me to the brink and I had to bail out of the job since it started to appear to me that people took either advantage of me via gaslighting or began to poke and see how I felt and how I would react to various tests. The stress at times became unbearable. Though through the years it has become easier and more acceptable at least somewhat. It appeared that they were not very well informed about the issues and yet there was some understanding. I chose to reveal the extent of my problems slowly. I also only spoke about these to my direct superior leaving other coworkers somewhat in the dark and not discussing about my disorder and any mental aspects with them. They seemed to have a hunch that something was wrong, though. 
So I only opened up about the disorder/disorders I  have after I left the job a couple of years ago. PS. Since there was no option in the survey to be on benefit support I chose to write about my last employment. Already mentioned. I do not think they took much note of the mental disorders, as I usually did not talk about them much. They spoke of their own depression and it seemed to me that it was to elicit my own story so that I would open up. I saw little point in that. Another time I struck up a short lived friendship and lost it as I moved jobs.

I revealed that I was having daily panic attacks on the way to work and having a difficult time coming in. They were not very understanding. Henceforth, I've never mentioned mental health issues specifically when needing time off for it.
