3319,2021,"My boss was pretty ambivalent. Seemed uncomfortable and unsure how to react. Nervously started talking about experiences she had that were not at all like what I was describing to her. I think she was *trying* to relate, when what I really needed was to feel heard. No actions were taken and honestly left the conversation feeling drained and a little dismissed. I've had conversations with members of our Neurodiversity/mental health group that have gone really well. I never really shake the feeling that I am oversharing though. For my other coworkers, I bring it up and feel heard/seen or validated in varying degrees but again, most of the time it feels like I've taken my clothes off. I have a few coworkers that I can be vulnerable with but mostly I'm left feeling cold. Because of my affiliation with the ERG I mentioned previously, I've had people reach out to me on several occassions to talk about their own mental health - in varying degrees of crisis. I do my best, but I often don't feel equipped. My goals this year are to complete training such as Mental Health First Aid so that I don't do more harm than good in these situations. No, none of my previous supervisors Only one boss. He gave helpful advice and later became my mentor. Sometimes he gave unhelpful advice (like, pick yourself up by your bootstraps kind of advice) but he would listen and I would feel that he heard and understood. No, at none of my previous employers I would be concerned that it would affect my ability to get the position because they would think I am somehow less capable than other applicants. Same answer. I don't want to be seen as less capable. They might make up a story based on what they have seen mental illness portrayed as in the media that I will cause problems, behave problematically, take a lot of management, or otherwise be a risky hire. We need to change people's minds about what the capabilities of people with mental illness are. Just because you have mental illness, does not mean ytou are resigned to a life that is sad, disconnected, difficult, or unprosperous. People need to understand that talking about these perceptions are the only way to change them. Love that you are doing this work, I've just heard about it through the ERG I mentioned. I am going to mention to leadership that we find ways to amplify what you are doing as we are also an open source company and I would love to see how we can support you.",0
1968,2017,"Stop putting an emphasis on the glory of overwork, classify mental health and physical health in the same type of leave reason. Also it's important to have a culture where you're not required to explain why you need leave. Most of us have a mental disorder or issue, so it's just a normal part of office talk. We regularly speak openly in the workplace about mental needs we may have at the time, and it is never treated as anything unusual, invalid, or dangerous. As above, it's just a regular and normal part of conversation. I do think it's getting better in certain areas, but not all. I think heavy Dev environments are worse off than tech adjacent areas, and I wonder if it is possibly in part due to the high male population, where it's more expected to put your head down and hide your emotions.

3264,2021,"I have regularly scheduled meetings with my manager weekly. If I feel that my performance has suffered because of my mental health, I try and mention that during those meetings. He listens and has shared his own experiences with anxiety and productivity concerns, and usually asks if there are any resources I'm lacking, or if the organization can support me more in any way. Because we have open discussions within the org, generally annually as a part of Mental health awareness month, or in times of stress like the onset of lockdown, I felt like open communication was a better option than leaving it unsaid. It also really helped that the first response from my manager when I brought up these concerns was empathy / sharing his own personal experiences with me, so we've built a very trusting relationship. I have a few confidants that I regularly speak to about anxiety. One of them started at the same time as me, so we have daily meeting on the calendar that we sometimes use if one of us needs some emotional support. We use it to lament about our knowledge gaps, pair program, chat about our personal lives, or help each other figure out how to talk about how we're feeling to our managers / co-workers. We also use it to validate each other into taking mental wellness days when we're anxious about taking too many because it's not a ""real sick day"" or we took ""too many already recently"". A common conversation I've had is ""I feel like such shit today, but I took two sick days last week and I just feel like it's too many."" To which the response is usually ""mental health should be a priority, and you should rest if you need to"". We also talk about imposter syndrome a lot and how we constantly feel like we don't know what we're doing and how we feel like everyone is smarter than us. But how that's also clearly wrong, and we're just mentally ill. I'm lucky to have someone that shares so many feelings with me. Some of my previous supervisors I didn't feel comfortable going into details, as I didn't want it to turn into a therapy session. So I generally kept it vague enough to seem like it could be physical illness: ""I don't feel well, I think I'll go home"" Yes, at all of my previous employers I would only talk about it within my friend circle, which included a friend from college who I already knew suffered from mental issues. We both talked about our depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. I have chronic back pain, which is a physical issue, but it rarely comes up when discussing whether or not I'd make a good potential employee. If anything, I'd just disclose that info to get certain resources like a standing desk. Otherwise, it's just rarely relevant to my day to day. Mental health affects my experience much more than my physical conditions. It feels like it would affect my hire-ability to know that there are regularly occurring days where I can't perform any engineering tasks because I'm overwhelmed / anxious / depressed. I would also worry that they wouldn't believe me, or think I was lazy, or question my work ethic, etc. Education and discussion. Managerial policies for handling direct reports with mental health issues. Mental wellness days as a separate category of sick days. Having done a few other jobs outside of the tech industry, mostly in the tutoring/physical activity instructor sphere, Engineering seems particularly challenging for those suffering from a mental illness. The irregularity can be disorienting as some days you're able to do your job just fine, and others you can feel completely paralyzed and anxious that if anyone found out, you'd be outed as a bad engineer. It compounds the imposter syndrome I feel as a woman in stem.",

My manager was curious but clearly not informed, and HR was very political. Ultimately, talking to my employer about my mental health led to no positive change and only increased anxiety. I bring up my mental health without being very specific as a way to inform coworkers about my tendencies in a team environment. I speak often, I pitch ideas, and I appreciate being called out when I go overboard. They are usually very thankful and responsive if I work with them on a daily basis, but coworkers that are not part of my team tend to not respond as well. I'm usually able to sense if someone is going through some sort of mental health related difficulty and I let them know that I'm there to listen or talk. They often open up about what is going on, specially if I share my own hardships first. Some of my previous supervisors At some of my previous employers Same as my previous answer. I would bring up physical health issues if they meant that I would require special accommodations or potential time off. I would bring up my mental health with a potential employer in order to analyze their response and get an idea of what the culture around mental health is. Also, I like to focus on my strengths and neurodiversity. I was promoted from engineer to engineering manager and the role was not well defined. I asked for help and feedback because I didn't know whether I was being effective or not and did not receive any help. This made my job very difficult, and went from being the #1 evaluated employee in the department as an engineer, to a very poor evaluation a year later. I am no longer an engineering manager and was demoted. Everyone is unique, and many of us have slightly different brains. The industry could benefit greatly from tapping into the strengths of this diversity and creating safe, productive environments.

However, when the director met with me for an evaluation, he addressed some concerns around breaks I was taking.  It was at this point I shared with him the conversations I had with the other two staff members and how I was addressing these gaps with their support.  His response was ""well while I appreciate the whole depression thing, you have to do your job"" and from that point forward, I found him treating me differently, for example, scheduling a meeting for a day when I was taking PTO where he shared information that directly impacted my team. I made decisions about which coworkers to discuss mental health with, but I have had conversations over lunch (off-site) about periodic anxiety, as well as conversations with some of my team mates about my misophonia as it has impacts on my focus and concentration in meetings so I like to make people aware of it so I can ask for accommodations when needed. Again the misophonia piece.  Additionally, I had open conversations with select colleagues about my anxiety and depression. I spoke openly about my misophonia with anyone I had to share working spaces with.

The coworkers that I talked to about my mental health were also closer friends. I went through some boughts of depression and extreme feelings of isolation.

2279,2017,"On an individual/peer level, I think there's some awareness that a lot of us have ""social"" issues that are sometimes related to mental health disorders/issues. It seems like that would give people in our industry at least a step up in handling the conversation. My experience seems to reflect that. On a more institutional level, I'm not sure of a best course that would fit all. In my personal experience, efforts toward supportive conversation and connection to relevant resources were lacking from management, so that's a good place to start. Depression/anxiety (related to diagnosed ADD) was exacerbated by a major physical injury caused some attendance issues with one employer. The conversation was not well received, or responded to. The general feeling was ""try harder""/""you're not trying hard enough"". Discussions with friends I made at work--maybe that's assumed in the question, but it wasn't just any coworker, or on any level a ""professional"" conversation.

They didn't say anything and looked unsure how to respond to me. We were friends before and after I left, so we talk regularly about our mental health disorders and managing them. Just sharing that they have ADD, and talking about how they can't eat after taking their meds (since the meds induce lack of appetite) In my experience, my mental health is compounded by others' reactions to portions of my identity -- Black, Queer, and assumed to be a Woman. I often feel like I don't have the space to discuss my mental health because I'm already a minority in so many ways.

They need to enforce required vacation/paid leave, allow anonymous reporting and feedback from all levels of workers, and finally, to hold management teams accountable for their team's mental health support. No one can take this on alone! Because of an untreated mental health issue, my coworker was subsequently murdered by her long-term boyfriend. She had a history of depression and emotional distress. She stayed in that abusive relationship for stability. Our management knew about this. He ended up beating her to death in their own house. He recently got convicted of her murder after three years of trial and prosecution. Same discussion as I had with my direct manager: openness to depression, PPD, and substance abuse from emotional stress and abusive relationships in high school. I told my direct manager that I had suffered from PPD and had a history of depression when I was younger. I also told her that I had a history of substance abuse and sought treatment twice for my condition. Both times in high school. Mental health is considered taboo in many Asian cultures. Growing up, I was told that depression was a myth that white Americans make up as an excuse to be lazy or weak. ""Talking about feelings"" was reserved for weak women.
