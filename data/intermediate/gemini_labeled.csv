1940,2017,"Educate employees about mental health and what wellness looks like. Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to. Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress. I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan. They told me they had similar experiences that I had spoken about and were looking for guidance and connection. Some of my previous supervisors",1

1699,2017,"The values of the tech industry are very much focused on day-to-day productivity, which can be very difficult for people with mental health issues. My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others. Not a response as such, but a previous manager made some derogatory comments about sufferers of ADHD that made me unwilling to open up to him when I was experiencing difficulties. I recently talked about my mental health struggles with a co-worker that I knew had some issues of her own. We were able to commiserate and provide some empathy for one another. I don't talk about mental health concerns with co-workers unless I have some indication of their views on the subject first. I have been very up front about my mental health concerns with my manager. We hada talk recently about how they've been affecting my productivity. He's been very supportive and has offered to help any way he can, though I haven't come up with useful accommodations to ask for. I have talked about depression, anxiety, and ADHD with previous coworkers. I chose who to talk to based on my understanding of their views such that I always found sympathetic listeners (often those with issues of their own). I have only had coworkers talk to me about their own mental health when I have opened the conversation by bringing up my own concerns/issues. I always try to extend as much empathy and support as I can. Usually, just having someone listen without judgment seems to help. Some of my previous supervisors",1

3340,2021,"I had an episode and went to the hospital. It was a panic attack. My direct manager took me there and stayed until I got accepted. I'm bipolar 2 and after this episode I started to be more open about my illness. It may be just an impression, but my coworkers started to be really careful about me and anytime they asked me about it it was ""how are you?"", ""are you feeling better?"", they were never capable of using the word bipolar, for example, as if it was a taboo of some sort. Some of my previous supervisors I was working too much and started to perform worse that it was supposed to be, given the amount of time I was putting. I was not aware at that point, but I was probably about to have a burnout. We went to this meeting, just three of us, to discuss technical related topics. At some point, my performance became a topic and I ended up crying. My coworker and manager were really understanding and made me feel comfortable, even though I was really afraid of crying in the workplace.  Till this day, I have a really good friendship with this coworker. By the way, this experience happened in another country (from the previous question). The previous one happened in Germany and this one in Brazil At some of my previous employers It was the outcome of some episode. I had to be open and tell them what was happening. After that, they became more understanding, but sometimes in a bad way, like if I was not capable to handle pressure as I would be before they knew about the illness. Of course, if we are talking about a physical health issue which is going to affect my work, I would bring, but if we are talking about, let's say, diabetes (and I have it under control) I cannot see any reasons for bring it to discussion in an interview. I cannot see the point of bringing it during the interview process. Just like the physical illness, I could bring it if it was something that could impact my performance. It seems to me that bad management makes a huge impact on people's mental health. It is where all the unnecessary pressure starts, the unnecessary short deadlines, the frequent change of priority. I think having the industry pacing down, respecting the processes, and giving people reasonable deadlines, would make a great difference. Other than that, a more humane HR, open channels for discussing mental health and more flexible vacation/sick days would represent a good change. It is normal having people from one country, living in another one answering this survey (I think). When asked about experiences, for instance, it would be nice, and probably interesting for the research, having the answers attached to the country where it happened. The experience I had in Brazil is completely different from the experience I'm having now living in Germany.",1

We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased. This was at a previous employer. In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc. In Slack, a coworker stated he was depressed and needed the teams help understanding that. It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for).

My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job.

Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.

A coworker and I both struggle with chronic anxiety, and I talked with her a lot right around the time I was starting to go to therapy. She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me. I explained that one of the goals set for me for the coming year (creating a training that involved a great deal of public speaking), created a lot of anxiety for me, and that in fact, I had been struggling with my anxiety for about six months prior to this conversation. My manager was incredibly understanding, and offered me the option to pause any conversations about my professional growth until I was ready to have them. in short, she allowed me to make the decision to ""lean out"" rather than ""lean in"" without any fear of repercussion so I could focus on my mental health, and then return to conversations about how to grow professionally once I decided I was ready.

Billable hours and timesheets are a false and pointless dataset. Work life balance is a sham. Flexibility is a double edged sword. 8 hour work days are arbitrary inventions with a history steeped in human rights movements to prevent capitalist abuse, not grounded in science or a sense of productivity or purpose. Time management and productivity hacking is all a traffic driving click bait farce. We should be adopting target driven business and staff management/ reporting approaches (which hopefully I'll get to build for one day if I don't kill myself first...). We are humans. We are messy and broken and that's supposed to be what makes life glorious, but instead of just quietly pursuing ""enough"", we're chained to our desks in an effort to protect our families well being in a sycophantic attempt to grab the proverbial dangled carrot from whoever sits above us in the food chain, who yells down  ""ENOUGH is just a little bit more"".
