2014,195,"Too many people even especially IT considered mental health issues as a choice or something people can freely act about. 

You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. 

In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(

I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health ""issues"" keep it for themselves.

2014,843,"I have been incredibly public about my own struggle in my own conversations and in social media insofar as how I can use my depression to raise awareness or help others. Because of that, my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said, the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job, simply because the information is public. Likewise, I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless, I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution.

It ended up spreading to more supervisors, and eventually my coworkers. Supers ""highly suggested"" treatment, but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue. I lost most of my desire to program due to the experience, not to mention thousands of dollars I lost - lost work time, vacation time they used for ""treatment"" time, doctors expenses, etc. I have major depressive disorder, high anxiety and mild agoraphobia. After seeing what treatment has to offer I will likely not seek it again and continue as is.

2014,1078,"I answered based on previous job at large technical company, where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.

I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope, I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) ""deserved"" stress was anxiety, caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing, I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.

It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing), I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.

Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:
1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day, four years later, despite being ""stable"" I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that, it would be seen as ""oh, I'm sorry"". I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.
2) Accomodations.
- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead, they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily, as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive, unnecessary appointment).
- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open, but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up, but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.
- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits, as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR, I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and ""putting on my dick hat"" to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling, and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package, I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being ""medically disqualified from this role"". I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Yes,,,,,Yes,,,Maybe,,No,,No,,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,,1,,,Yes,,,,,Very difficult,,More than 1000,,,,,,,,Often,,,,,,,,,Washington,Yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,United States,,27,Female,,,,Yes,Some of them,,No,Maybe,,,,,,

2014,1174,"I burnt out this year. I worked too much, had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.

I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating, sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work, couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.

My employers response, after a while, was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor, which my employer agreed to, only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent, bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat, gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.

I had previously been told by my employer that I ""was too young to burn out"" and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to ""get myself together"" and ultimately, given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer, left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,No,,,Maybe,,No,,No,,,No,No,,No,,,,,,1,,,Yes,,,,,Very difficult,,1-5,,,,,,,,Sometimes,,,,,,,,,-1,Don't know,1,,,,,,,,,,,United Kingdom,,23,Male,,,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,

Things like ""You're crazy"" when you do something silly or say something weird for example. There is no bad intent with it, but it is still a potentially destructive word to someone struggling, especially silently. I believe education is the largest thing that could help, but instituting mental health awareness and general assistance programs could also go a long way.

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.",-1,A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it,-1,0,1,0,,,None did,None did,-1,Yes,,,Yes,-1,1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,-1,,No,Yes,1,1,0,1,Possibly,,,Maybe/Not sure,"Yes, I experienced",-1,"No, none did",,-1,26-100,Very open,Somewhat easy,,-1,6,,-1,,Rarely,Often,-1,-1,-1,-1,,,-1,I don't know,1,1,5,5,6,6,2,I don't know,1,N/A (none offered),-1,Canada,Canada,35,female,-1,,Maybe,,,1,No,,Maybe,No,Physical health,,Some of my previous supervisors,Same level of comfort for each

Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. ","My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy.

I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them.

2019,3898,,0,0,"For software engineers having a depression or a mental illness is almost the equivalent of disability. If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",-1,-1,-1,-1,"They were my coworkers but they are my friends, so the talks were very productive and they were/are supportive.","As simple as it could be I was direct and, at that moment I was ok, if I was fired, and said that I needed therapy and probably treatment for my stress level.

Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship.","As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work.

Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis.","My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation.","This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed.
